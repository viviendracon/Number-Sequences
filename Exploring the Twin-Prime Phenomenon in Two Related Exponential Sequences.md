# Exploring the Twin-Prime Phenomenon in Two Related Exponential Sequences

## Abstract

We investigate a curious twin-prime phenomenon arising from two related exponential sequences of integers:

- $s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1$, and  
- $t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3$,

for $n \\ge 0$.  These sequences produce prime numbers in tandem for certain small values of $n$ (notably $n=1,3,7$), yielding prime pairs $(s\_n,,t\_n)$ that differ by 2 – i.e. twin primes. We explore the structural reasons behind this phenomenon and assess its generality. In particular, we examine congruence properties showing that $s\_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ while $t\_n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$, and discuss how this forces the multiplicative order of 2 modulo $s\_n$ (when prime) to be **half** of the full group order, whereas for $t\_n$ (when prime) the order of 2 is often **full** (making 2 a primitive root modulo $t\_n$). We present computational data up to $n=500$ demonstrating the rarity of twin primes in these sequences beyond the few initial cases. Using heuristics in the spirit of the Bateman–Horn conjecture, we argue that the probability of infinitely many such twin primes is exceedingly low (likely only finitely many exist). Connections to Artin’s conjecture on primitive roots are made to interpret the observed full-period reciprocals of $1/t\_n$ in base-2. Finally, we discuss cryptographic implications of primes that admit 2 as a primitive root (maximal period primes), noting that the $t\_n$ sequence provides a source of such primes (albeit sparse), which could be relevant for pseudorandom number generation and hash functions requiring long periodic sequences.

## Introduction

The Twin Prime Conjecture – that there are infinitely many prime pairs $(p, p+2)$ – is one of the most famous open problems in number theory. In practice, finding **parametrizations** that produce twin primes is extremely challenging, as primes are sparse and twin primes even sparser. In this paper, we explore a particular structured approach to generating potential twin primes: using two exponential expressions that differ by 2\. Specifically, we consider the sequences:

$$s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1,$$ $$t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3,$$

for integer $n \\ge 0$. By construction, $t\_n \- s\_n \= 2$ for every $n$, so any instance where both $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are prime immediately yields a twin prime pair. The **empirical spark** for this investigation is the observation that for a few small values of $n$, both $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are indeed prime, forming twin primes. For example:

- At $n=1$: $s\_1 \= 137$ and $t\_1 \= 139$ are both prime, giving the twin prime pair $(137,,139)$.  
- At $n=3$: $s\_3 \= 2081$ and $t\_3 \= 2083$ are prime, another twin prime pair.  
- At $n=7$: $s\_7 \= 524801$ and $t\_7 \= 524803$ are prime, yet another twin prime pair.

These instances prompt natural questions: *Are there deeper reasons these forms produce twin primes? How often might this occur? Could there be infinitely many $n$ with $(s\_n, t\_n)$ twin primes, or only finitely many?* In this work, we delve into these questions by examining both theoretical properties (congruences, orders of 2 modulo the primes, etc.) and computational evidence.

After defining the sequences and noting the initial twin prime examples in §2, we analyze in §3 the congruence properties of $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ modulo small bases (especially 8). This reveals a stark difference: whenever $n\\ge1$, any prime of the form $s\_n$ must be congruent to 1 mod 8, whereas any prime of the form $t\_n$ is congruent to 3 mod 8\. This difference has important consequences for the **multiplicative order of 2** modulo these primes. We show that if $s\_n$ is prime, 2 cannot be a primitive root (its order is at most half of $s\_n-1$), whereas if $t\_n$ is prime, 2 is a quadratic non-residue and often a **primitive root** (achieving the maximum possible order modulo $t\_n$). In §4 we present extensive computational data for $1 \\le n \\le 500$, finding that beyond the small cases ($n=1,3,7$) no further twin primes occur in this range. We also catalog the sporadic occurrences where *either* $s\_n$ or $t\_n$ alone is prime, underscoring that the simultaneous primality needed for twins is much rarer. Section 5 uses probabilistic heuristic models (akin to the Bateman–Horn conjecture and the prime number theorem) to argue that the expected number of twin primes in these sequences is finite. In particular, we estimate that the density of $n$ producing twin primes decreases so rapidly (roughly on the order of $1/n^2$) that the sum of their probabilities converges – strongly suggesting only finitely many such $n$ exist. In §6 we connect our findings to **Artin’s conjecture on primitive roots**, noting that the $t\_n$ primes (which are 3 mod 8\) fall into the category of primes for which 2 *could* be a primitive root. Artin’s conjecture predicts that a positive proportion (\~37.4%) of such primes indeed have 2 as a primitive root ([Artin's Constant \-- from Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArtinsConstant.html#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20Artin%27s%20constant,corresponding%20to%20a%20cyclic%20number)), providing context for why many of the $t\_n$ primes exhibit full-period binary reciprocals. Finally, in §7 we discuss possible cryptographic implications. Primes $p$ for which 2 is a generator of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\*$ have maximal period binary expansions and can produce long-period pseudorandom sequences. The $t\_n$ sequence yields many primes with this property (albeit with unpredictable $n$), and we outline how such primes could be used in cryptographic applications requiring maximal periodicity (for example, in linear congruential generators or hashing schemes). We conclude in §8 with a summary and some open questions.

## Background and Initial Observations

Before analyzing the sequences $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ in depth, we establish some basic properties and present the known twin prime instances in a consolidated form. We also recall relevant number theory results (quadratic residues, primitive roots, heuristic prime density conjectures) that will be used later.

**Basic structure of $s\_n$ and $t\_n$.** We can rewrite the definitions in a suggestive way:

- $s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1 \= 2^{n+2}(2^{n+3} \+ 2\) \+ 1$.  
- $t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3 \= 2^{n+2}(2^{n+3} \+ 2\) \+ 3$.

Notice that $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ share the large factor $2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2}$; indeed $t\_n \= s\_n \+ 2$. For $n=0$, these formulas give $s\_0 \= 2^5 \+ 2^2 \+ 1 \= 37$ (which is prime) and $t\_0 \= 2^5 \+ 2^2 \+ 3 \= 39$ (not prime). Starting from $n=1$ onward, $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are odd numbers (since $2^{2n+5}$ and $2^{n+2}$ are multiples of 8 for $n\\ge1$, their sum with 1 or 3 remains odd). Thus for $n\\ge1$, $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are odd integers differing by 2 – a necessary condition for being twin primes.

**Known twin-prime instances $(s\_n, t\_n)$.** As mentioned, a search for small $n$ yields a few cases where both $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are prime. These are listed in **Table 1**. Each of these corresponds to a genuine twin prime pair since $t\_n \= s\_n \+ 2$. Notably, after $n=7$ no other $n$ up to 500 has been found to give twin primes (this computational result will be detailed in §4).

| $n$ | $s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1$ | $t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3$ | Twin prime pair? |
| ----: | ----: | ----: | :---- |
| 1 | $2^7 \+ 2^3 \+ 1 \= 137$ | $2^7 \+ 2^3 \+ 3 \= 139$ | Yes – $(137,,139)$ |
| 3 | $2^{11} \+ 2^5 \+ 1 \= 2081$ | $2^{11} \+ 2^5 \+ 3 \= 2083$ | Yes – $(2081,,2083)$ |
| 7 | $2^{19} \+ 2^9 \+ 1 \= 524801$ | $2^{19} \+ 2^9 \+ 3 \= 524803$ | Yes – $(524801,,524803)$ |

**Table 1: Known cases (for small $n$) where $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are both prime, yielding twin prime pairs.** No other twin prime pairs occur for $n \\le 500$ in these sequences (based on our exhaustive search; see §4). All primes $s\_n$ with $n\\ge1$ are $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ and all $t\_n$ primes are $\\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$, a fact explained in §3.

It is worth noting that beyond these three values of $n$, we do find occasional primes in one sequence *without* a matching prime in the other. For example, $s\_{23}$ is prime (approximately $2.2518\\times10^{15}$), but $t\_{23}$ is composite; on the other hand, $t\_{13} \= 2^{31} \+ 2^{15} \+ 3 \= 2147516419$ is prime, while $s\_{13}$ is not. These solitary primes underscore that the twin prime occurrences require an alignment of both sequences hitting prime at the same $n$, which becomes increasingly rare.

**Number theory background.** Two classical results play a role in our analysis: (1) criteria for 2 being a quadratic residue or non-residue modulo a prime, and (2) Artin’s conjecture on primitive roots.

- *Quadratic residue status of 2:* For an odd prime $p$, the Legendre symbol $(2/p)$ can be evaluated by a well-known supplement to quadratic reciprocity. In particular, one has $(2/p) \= (-1)^{\\frac{p^2-1}{8}}$. This means ([Gauss’ lemma](https://planetmath.org/GaussLemma#:~:text=Remarks%3A%20Using%20Gauss%E2%80%99%20Lemma%2C%20it,for%20any%20odd%20prime)):  
    
  - $(2/p) \= 1$ (i.e. 2 is a quadratic residue mod $p$) if and only if $p \\equiv \\pm1 \\pmod{8}$,  
  - $(2/p) \= \-1$ (2 is a non-residue mod $p$) if and only if $p \\equiv \\pm3 \\pmod{8}$.


  Equivalently, primes congruent to $1$ or $7$ modulo 8 make 2 a square modulo $p$, whereas primes congruent to $3$ or $5$ modulo 8 make 2 a nonsquare. This simple criterion will be crucial in distinguishing $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ primes.


- *Primitive root (Artin’s conjecture):* A **primitive root modulo $p$** is an integer $g$ of order $p-1$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\*$, meaning $g$ generates the entire multiplicative group. Not every prime has 2 as a primitive root (in fact, roughly 37.4% of primes do, according to Artin’s conjecture ([Artin's Constant \-- from Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArtinsConstant.html#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20Artin%27s%20constant,corresponding%20to%20a%20cyclic%20number))). Artin’s conjecture on primitive roots states that for any fixed integer $a$ that is not $-1$ or a perfect square, there are infinitely many primes $p$ for which $a$ is a primitive root, and asymptotically the density of such primes among all primes is given by a constant (Artin’s constant $C\_{\\text{Artin}}\\approx0.37395$ for $a=2$). While still unproven in general, this conjecture provides a heuristic guideline: primes $p$ with $2$ as a primitive root are not rare, but they are constrained by congruence conditions (for instance, as noted above, $p$ must be $3$ or $5$ mod 8 for 2 to even have a chance to be a generator).

With these preliminaries in hand, we proceed to analyze the sequences $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ in detail, beginning with their modular properties.

## Congruence Properties and Binary Periods of $s\_n$ and $t\_n$

A striking initial observation is that the sequences $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are each confined to a single residue class modulo 8 (for $n\\ge1$). This has far-reaching implications for the nature of these numbers, including their divisibility by small primes and the behavior of their multiplicative orders.

**Lemma 1\.** For every integer $n\\ge1$,

- $s\_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$,  
- $t\_n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$.

*Proof.* Consider $2^{2n+5}$ and $2^{n+2}$ modulo 8\. If $n\\ge1$, then $2n+5 \\ge 7$ and $n+2 \\ge 3$, so $2^{2n+5}$ is divisible by $2^7=128$ (hence by 8), and $2^{n+2}$ is divisible by $2^3=8$. Therefore $2^{2n+5} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ and $2^{n+2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$. It follows that

- $s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1 \\equiv 0 \+ 0 \+ 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$,  
- $t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3 \\equiv 0 \+ 0 \+ 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$.

In particular, for $n\\ge1$, $s\_n$ is never divisible by 2 or 4 (it is $1 \\mod 8$), and $t\_n$ is never divisible by 2 (it is $3 \\mod 8$). This explains why in Table 1 all $s\_n$ primes end in the digit 1 in base 8 and all $t\_n$ primes end in 3 in base 8\.

One immediate consequence of Lemma 1 is that any prime $p=s\_n$ (with $n\\ge1$) satisfies $p\\equiv1\\pmod{8}$, and any prime $q=t\_n$ satisfies $q\\equiv3\\pmod{8}$. By the quadratic residue criterion stated earlier, we conclude:

- If $s\_n$ is prime, $(2/s\_n)=1$. In other words, 2 is a quadratic **residue** mod $s\_n$. Equivalently, $2^{{(s\_n-1)}/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{s\_n}$ (by Euler’s criterion).  
- If $t\_n$ is prime, $(2/t\_n)=-1$. So 2 is a quadratic **non-residue** mod $t\_n$, meaning $2^{{(t\_n-1)}/2} \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{t\_n}$.

These relations shed light on the multiplicative order of 2 modulo these primes. Recall that the **order** of 2 mod $p$ (for prime $p$ not dividing 2\) is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that $2^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. This order $d$ must divide $p-1$ (by Fermat’s little theorem). If $d \= p-1$, then 2 is a primitive root mod $p$ (full order); if $d \< p-1$, 2 is not a primitive root.

From the above residue facts: for $p=s\_n$ prime, since $2^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1$, the order of 2 modulo $p$ is *at most* $(p-1)/2$. In practice, it could be exactly $(p-1)/2$ or some proper divisor thereof, but it certainly is not $p-1$. In contrast, for $q=t\_n$ prime, $2^{(q-1)/2} \\equiv \-1$, which means the order of 2 is *not* a divisor of $(q-1)/2$. In fact, the order of 2 in this case is either $q-1$ (the full length) or a divisor that is not $(q-1)/2$ — it could be $(q-1)/f$ for some other factor $f\>2$. There is no divisibility by 2 issue because $(q-1)/2$ gave $-1$, so the order is an even multiple of that half-period. Often, one finds it to be exactly $q-1$.

To illustrate, consider the twin prime examples:

- For $s\_1=137$ (which is $1 \\mod 8$), indeed $2^{68} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{137}$ and one checks that 68 is the *smallest* exponent giving 1 (so the order of 2 mod 137 is 68, exactly half of 136). Thus 2 is *not* a primitive root mod 137; the binary expansion of $1/137$ will have a repeating cycle of length 68 bits (half the maximum) since the repetend length in base 2 equals the order of 2 mod 137\. By contrast, $t\_1=139$ is $3 \\mod 8$, and indeed $2^{138} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{139}$ while $2^{69} \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{139}$ (with no smaller exponent giving \+1). Therefore the order of 2 mod 139 is the full 138, meaning 2 *is* a primitive root of 139 ([Primes having 2 as a primitive root \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3260673/primes-having-2-as-a-primitive-root#:~:text=Test%202%20%3A%20%24p%20,8)) ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=Binary%20full%20reptend%20prime%20sequences,4)). The binary expansion of $1/139$ has a maximal period of 138 bits.  
    
- For $n=3$, $s\_3=2081 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ and indeed $2^{1040} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2081}$ with order $1040 \= (2081-1)/2$. Meanwhile $2^{2082} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2083}$ for $t\_3=2083$ (and $2^{1041} \\equiv \-1$), so the order of 2 mod 2083 is 2082 (again primitive root).  
    
- A more nuanced case is $n=7$: $s\_7=524801$ gave $2^{262400} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{524801}$, and indeed the order is $262400 \= (524801-1)/2$. For $t\_7=524803$, one finds $2^{524802} \\equiv 1$ but interestingly the order of 2 is **not** 524802; in fact $2^{174934} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{524803}$, indicating an order of $174934 \= 524802/3$. In this case 2 is a quadratic non-residue mod 524803 (as expected for $3\\mod 8$), but it fails to be a primitive root because of a different divisor (here 3\) of $p-1$ that causes an early repetition. Thus 2 has *full half-order* in $s\_n$ primes and *usually* full order in $t\_n$ primes, though exceptions occur when other prime factors of $t\_n-1$ intervene (here 3 divided $524802$ and also divided the order). We will discuss the frequency of such exceptions in §6.

The above examples suggest a general tendency: **primes of the form $s\_n$ have “half-period” binary reciprocals, while primes of the form $t\_n$ often have “full-period” reciprocals.** In other words, for $s\_n$ primes the length of the repeating binary cycle of $1/s\_n$ is typically $(s\_n-1)/2$, whereas for $t\_n$ primes it is often $t\_n-1$. This is a direct consequence of 2 being a quadratic residue vs. non-residue, respectively. We can formalize this as follows:

**Proposition 2\.** Let $n\\ge1$ and suppose $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are prime.

1. The multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $s\_n$ divides $\\frac{s\_n-1}{2}$. In particular, $2$ is *not* a primitive root of $s\_n$. If $s\_n$ is prime, the binary expansion of $1/s\_n$ has a period length that is at most half of $s\_n-1$ (in practice often exactly half, barring a smaller factor).  
     
2. The multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $t\_n$ is **not** a divisor of $\\frac{t\_n-1}{2}$. In fact, $2^{(t\_n-1)/2} \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{t\_n}$, so the order is $2d$ for some odd $d$ dividing $(t\_n-1)$. Frequently (though not guaranteed in every case) the order is $t\_n-1$ itself, meaning $2$ is a primitive root mod $t\_n$ and $1/t\_n$ has full period $t\_n-1$ in base 2\.

*Proof.* The key observations have already been made: if $s\_n$ is prime then $s\_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$, implying $2^{(s\_n-1)/2}\\equiv1$. By definition of order, this means the order of 2 divides $(s\_n-1)/2$. For $t\_n$ prime, $t\_n\\equiv3\\pmod{8}$ so $2^{(t\_n-1)/2}\\equiv-1$. This shows the order of 2 is *twice* some odd factor of $t\_n-1$ (in particular, not a divisor of $(t\_n-1)/2$). If no other smaller factor of $t\_n-1$ yields an exponent giving 1, then the order is $t\_n-1$. If a smaller odd factor $d$ of $t\_n-1$ exists such that $2^d\\equiv1$, then the order would be that $d$ times 2\. In all cases, the order is even and larger than $(t\_n-1)/2$. The statement about binary period follows because the repetend length of $1/p$ in base 2 is equal to the order of 2 mod $p$ (for $p\\neq2,5$ which is satisfied here).

Proposition 2 explains the complementary nature of the primes in each twin pair: one of the pair (the $s\_n$ prime) has 2 as a quadratic residue, the other ($t\_n$ prime) has 2 as a non-residue. This situation is not unique to our sequences but is true for *any* twin prime pair beyond $(3,5)$. In general, if $(p, p+2)$ are twin primes with $p\>3$, one of them must be $\\equiv1\\pmod{4}$ and the other $\\equiv3\\pmod{4}$ (since one of any two odd numbers 2 apart is divisible by 4). In fact, mod 8 one can check that the possible patterns for twin primes $(p, p+2)$ (excluding the pair $(3,5)$) are exactly $(p\\mod8,,p+2\\mod8)\\in{(1,3), (3,5), (5,7), (7,1)}$. In each case, one of the primes is $1\\pmod{4}$ (making 2 a quadratic residue there) and the other is $3\\pmod{4}$ (making 2 a non-residue there). Our sequences $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ specifically realize the $(1\\mod8,;3\\mod8)$ pattern for every twin prime pair they produce. Thus, in a twin prime pair generated by $(s\_n, t\_n)$, $s\_n$ is always the "quadratic-residue prime" and $t\_n$ the "quadratic-nonresidue prime" with respect to 2\. This nicely fits the theory: one prime in the pair allows a half-length cycle (binary) and the other permits potentially full length.

The distinction between half-period and full-period primes is significant in various applications (see §7). But before turning to applications and conjectures, we first quantify *how often* these sequences produce primes at all, and twin primes in particular, by presenting computational data.

## Computational Data up to $n=500$

We performed an exhaustive computer search for primes of the form $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ for $1 \\le n \\le 500$. The search utilized probabilistic primality tests (Miller–Rabin) with enough rounds to ensure confidence, given that $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ grow exponentially with $n$. The largest numbers tested (around $n=500$) have on the order of $10^{300}$ digits (since $2^{2n+5}$ dominates $s\_n$, and $2^{2\*500+5} \= 2^{1005}$ is roughly $10^{(1005 \\log\_{10}2)} \\approx 10^{302}$). Despite their size, checking primality for each $n$ is feasible due to the moderate number of cases (500 values for each sequence) and the efficiency of modern algorithms for numbers with a few hundred digits.

The results of this computation can be summarized as follows:

- **Twin primes:** As mentioned, we found *no* new twin prime pairs beyond $n \= 7$ in the range $1 \\le n \\le 500$. The only values of $n$ in this range that yield twin primes are $n \= 1, 3, 7$ (the ones listed in Table 1). In particular, for every $n=8,9,\\dots,500$, at least one of $s\_n$ or $t\_n$ is composite (and usually both are).  
    
- **Primes in single sequences:** Interestingly, each sequence individually produces primes for several scattered values of $n$. Up to 500, we found $17$ values of $n$ for which $s\_n$ is prime, and $8$ values for which $t\_n$ is prime (these include the three twin-prime-producing $n$ for each sequence). Excluding the twin prime cases, there are 14 instances where $s\_n$ alone is prime and 5 instances where $t\_n$ alone is prime in this range. A few examples:  
    
  - $s\_{23}$ is prime (as noted, $s\_{23}=2^{51}+2^{25}+1$ is a 16-digit prime), while $t\_{23}$ is composite.  
  - $t\_{13}$, $t\_{15}$, and $t\_{17}$ are prime (each around the 10-digit range), whereas $s\_{13}, s\_{15}, s\_{17}$ are composite.  
  - For larger $n$, $s\_{174}$, $s\_{260}$, $s\_{390}$, $s\_{484}$ were found to be prime (huge primes with \~53, \~79, \~118, \~146 digits respectively), none accompanied by a prime $t\_n$. Likewise $t\_{181}$ and $t\_{493}$ were prime (each around 300 digits) with $s\_{181}, s\_{493}$ composite.


  The occurrence of primes in either sequence becomes very sparse as $n$ grows. By $n\>100$, only a handful of $s\_n$ or $t\_n$ are prime in our range, and none coincide as twins.


- **Divisibility obstacles:** The rarity of primes at large $n$ is partly explained by the fact that as $n$ increases, $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ encounter many automatic divisibility conditions that eliminate them from primality. For example, for *any even* $n$, $t\_n$ is divisible by 3\. This is because if $n$ is even, $n+2$ is even, so $2^{n+2}\\equiv 1\\pmod{3}$ (since $2^2=4\\equiv1\\pmod{3}$) and $2^{2n+5}\\equiv 2^{(even)+1} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$; hence $t\_n \\equiv 2+1+3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Indeed, our data show no $t\_n$ with $n$ even was prime (they are all divisible by 3). This means $t\_n$ primes can only occur for odd $n$. Similarly, one can find that for certain modulus classes $n$ will make $s\_n$ or $t\_n$ divisible by small primes (e.g., $n \\equiv 6$ or $9 \\pmod{10}$ forces $s\_n$ to be divisible by 11, etc.), pruning out many cases (see discussion in §5). As $n$ grows, the accumulation of such congruence obstructions makes primes rarer.

To visualize the distribution, imagine marking a point for each $n \\le 500$ on two separate lines – one line for $s\_n$ and one for $t\_n$ – coloring the point green if the number is prime and red if it is composite. The *green* points thin out as $n$ increases. For $s\_n$, you would see green at $n=1,3,7$, then a scattering (23,32,34,40,50,174,... as listed) – about 17 green out of 500\. For $t\_n$, green at $1,3,7,13,15,17,181,493$ – just 8 out of 500\. Only at $n=1,3,7$ do both lines have green simultaneously (twin primes). This empirical data already suggests that twin occurrences are extremely scarce beyond the very small $n$.

It is worth mentioning that *if* one extends the search further (say to $n=1000$), the expectation (based on heuristics in the next section) is to maybe find at most a couple more individual primes in each sequence and likely no new twin pairs unless a very rare coincidence occurs. Given the growth in size of $s\_n, t\_n$, such a search becomes more intensive, but the trends observed up to 500 provide a solid basis for conjectures.

In summary, up to $n=500$ we found 3 twin prime pairs, 17 total $s\_n$ primes, and 8 total $t\_n$ primes. This suggests that requiring *simultaneous* primality of $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ is much stricter than requiring primality of one sequence alone. In the next section, we formalize this intuition using heuristic probability models to argue that the twin prime phenomenon observed (with $n=1,3,7$) is likely a finite occurrence.

## Distribution Analysis and Heuristics (Are There Infinitely Many Cases?)

Given the computational evidence that twin primes from these sequences seem to stop at $n=7$ (at least up to $n=500$), a natural question is whether it is plausible for infinitely many such $n$ to exist. While we cannot provide a definitive proof, we can employ heuristic reasoning similar to the Bateman–Horn conjecture to estimate the density of $n$ for which $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are prime simultaneously. All signs point to this being an extremely rare (and likely finite) phenomenon.

**Heuristic via prime density.** For large $n$, $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are roughly of size $\\approx 2^{2n}$ (since $2^{2n+5}$ dominates the value). The prime number theorem suggests that a "random" number of magnitude $M$ has probability about $1/\\ln M$ of being prime. If we (boldly) treat $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ as random odd numbers of size $\\sim 2^{2n}$ (while correcting for obvious non-random features like divisibility constraints), then the probability $s\_n$ is prime is about $1/\\ln(2^{2n}) \= 1/(2n \\ln 2)$, and similarly $t\_n$ is prime with probability $\\sim 1/(2n \\ln 2)$. If we further (very optimistically) assumed $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ primality are independent events, then the probability that *both* are prime would be roughly the product: $$\\mathbb{P}(s\_n \\text{ prime and } t\_n \\text{ prime}) \\sim \\frac{1}{(2n \\ln 2)^2} \= \\frac{1}{4(\\ln 2)^2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{n^2}.$$ In other words, the chance drops off on the order of $1/n^2$ for large $n$. This is an extremely rapidly decreasing probability. Indeed, the sum of probabilities $\\sum\_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}$ converges (to $\\pi^2/6$). This means we expect only on the order of a constant number of $n$ to yield the desired twin prime outcome overall. In fact, plugging in $\\frac{1}{4(\\ln 2)^2} \\approx 0.520$ as a rough constant, the expected *total* number of twin prime cases from $n=1$ to $\\infty$ would be about $0.520 \\sum\_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} \= 0.520 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} \\approx 0.520 \\cdot 1.6449 \\approx 0.856$. Of course, one cannot literally have a non-integer expected count of cases, but this calculation suggests that finding even *one* or *two* such cases might be in line with expectation – and indeed we found three cases ($n=1,3,7$) which is somewhat higher than 0.856 but still on the order of a few. The heuristic would strongly suggest that expecting infinitely many (meaning the series of probabilities would diverge) is unjustified here.

One might refine this heuristic by including the contribution of the **twin prime constant** $C\_2\\approx0.660161$ which appears in the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture for twin primes ([Twin stars and twin primes](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/08/14/twin-stars-and-twin-primes/#:~:text=Image%3A%20%5Cpi_2%28x%29%20%5Csim%20C_2%20%5Cint_2,2)). The classical twin prime conjecture says $\\pi\_2(x) \\sim 2C\_2 \\int\_2^x \\frac{dt}{(\\ln t)^2}$ where $\\pi\_2(x)$ is the number of twin primes $\\le x$ ([Twin stars and twin primes](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/08/14/twin-stars-and-twin-primes/#:~:text=Image%3A%20%5Cpi_2%28x%29%20%5Csim%20C_2%20%5Cint_2,2)). In our scenario, however, $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are highly structured and grow exponentially in $n$. A more appropriate model is given by the **Bateman–Horn conjecture** (BH), which generalizes Hardy–Littlewood to arbitrary polynomial expressions ([Bateman–Horn conjecture \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%E2%80%93Horn_conjecture#:~:text=)). BH would consider the polynomials $f\_1(n) \= 2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ and $f\_2(n) \= 2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+3$, and attempt to estimate the density of $n$ such that both $f\_1(n)$ and $f\_2(n)$ are prime. However, $f\_1$ and $f\_2$ are not polynomials in $n$ in the usual sense – they are exponential-exponential functions of $n$. To still apply BH reasoning, one might treat $f\_1$ and $f\_2$ as *approximately* $2^{2n}$ in size and consider the necessary divisibility conditions (the so-called Bunyakovsky conditions ([Bateman–Horn conjecture \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%E2%80%93Horn_conjecture#:~:text=The%20Bateman%E2%80%93Horn%20conjecture%20provides%20a,to%20p%2C%20which%20can%20only))). A crucial condition for BH is that there is no prime $p$ that always divides the product $f\_1(n)f\_2(n)$ for all $n$ (if such a prime existed, it would forbid infinitely many both being prime). In our case, because $f\_2(n) \- f\_1(n) \= 2$, any prime $p\\ge3$ can divide at most one of $f\_1(n)$ or $f\_2(n)$ for a given $n$, but cannot divide both (except $p=2$ which divides neither since $f\_1,f\_2$ are odd for $n\\ge1$). So there is no single prime that divides $f\_1(n)f\_2(n)$ for *every* $n$. This satisfies the broad necessary condition for simultaneously prime values to possibly be infinite ([Bateman–Horn conjecture \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%E2%80%93Horn_conjecture#:~:text=The%20Bateman%E2%80%93Horn%20conjecture%20provides%20a,to%20p%2C%20which%20can%20only)). Thus, BH *permits* the possibility of infinitely many $n$ giving twin primes in theory, but it gives a conjectural density formula that one can integrate. Without deriving it fully, the outcome aligns with the earlier simple argument: the sum $\\sum\_{n} \\frac{2C\_2}{(\\ln f\_1(n) \\ln f\_2(n))}$ converges, predicting a finite total number of solutions. In fact, using asymptotic $\\ln f\_1(n) \\sim \\ln(2^{2n}) \= 2n\\ln 2$ (and same for $f\_2$) yields the $1/n^2$ behavior we found. The twin prime constant $2C\_2$ would modestly adjust the coefficient from our naive $1/\[4(\\ln 2)^2\]$ to $\\frac{2C\_2}{\[2\\ln 2\]^2} \= \\frac{C\_2}{2(\\ln 2)^2} \\approx \\frac{0.660}{2 \\cdot 0.480} \\approx 0.686$. Then the expected total count would be $0.686 \\sum 1/n^2 \\approx 0.686 \\cdot 1.6449 \\approx 1.129$. So about $1$ twin prime pair expected in total, according to this heuristic. The fact that we see three such pairs for small $n$ can be attributed to the unpredictability of small-number behavior and the large error margins in such a heuristic for small ranges. But the key point is that no heuristic model predicts an unbounded count; on the contrary, they consistently suggest only a few sporadic solutions in total.

It is also instructive to examine specific modulus constraints that cut down the possibilities as $n$ grows. We mentioned earlier that if $n$ is even, $t\_n$ is divisible by 3, so $n$ must be odd for twin primes. Further, consider modulo 5 or 7 conditions, etc. For instance, one can show: if $n \\equiv 2$ or $4 \\pmod{6}$, then $s\_n$ is divisible by 7 (a quick check: $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1 \\pmod{7}$ cycles with period 3 in $n$, leading to certain residues being 0). There are many such patterns. Each such condition eliminates an arithmetic progression of $n$ from consideration. As more primes impose such conditions (though none eliminates *all* $n$ outright), the set of $n$ that avoid all small-prime divisibilities becomes very sparse. One can view the probability of $n$ surviving all these small prime tests as the product $\\prod\_{p}\\left(1 \- \\frac{\\omega(p)}{p}\\right)$ where $\\omega(p)$ is the number of residue classes mod $p$ that make either $s\_n$ or $t\_n$ divisible by $p$. For large $n$, this product tends to a nonzero constant if the $\\omega(p)$ are “benign” (this constant is analogous to the constant $C\_2$ in twin primes, which is $\\prod\_{p\\ge3}\\left(1 \- \\frac{2}{(p-1)^2}\\right)$). In our case, one can derive a similar constant. But after all those conditions, the residual probability that both numbers are prime still decays as $\\sim 1/( (\\ln s\_n)(\\ln t\_n) ) \\approx 1/(4 (\\ln 2)^2 n^2)$, so the sum converges.

**Conjecture:** *(Finiteness of the twin-prime generating $n$)* Based on the above reasoning, we conjecture that there are only finitely many integers $n$ for which $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are both prime. Equivalently, the initial cases $n=1,3,7$ (and possibly a few larger $n$ beyond our search range, if any exist) are the only solutions to $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ and $+3$ both being prime. In all likelihood, no infinitely large values of $n$ will continue to produce twin primes in this form.

This conjecture is in stark contrast to the **Twin Prime Conjecture** for arbitrary primes (which expects infinitely many twin primes). The difference is that here we are looking at a very specific exponentially growing pattern of numbers. While the general set of primes certainly contains infinitely many twin primes (conjecturally), the subsequence that lie on the curves $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ is far too sparse to inherit that infinitude – much like how there are infinitely many primes of the form $n^2+1$ conjecturally, but a sequence like $2^{2^k}+1$ (Fermat numbers) likely has only finitely many primes, or how Mersenne primes (numbers of the form $2^p-1$) are believed to be infinite but extremely sparse.

In summary, the distribution analysis provides a quantitative explanation for why we observe only a few twin prime instances: the probability declines faster than the number of trials grows, leading to an expectation of finitely many successes.

## Connections to Artin’s Primitive Root Conjecture

One intriguing aspect of this twin-prime construction is how it naturally pairs a prime that fails to have 2 as a generator with a prime that often does have 2 as a generator. Artin’s conjecture offers a lens to interpret this: roughly 37% of primes (those with no unexpected obstacles in their factorization of $p-1$) should have 2 as a primitive root ([Artin's Constant \-- from Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArtinsConstant.html#:~:text=conjectured%20that%20the%20density%20of,by%20%2086%2C%20where)) ([Artin's Constant \-- from Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArtinsConstant.html#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20Artin%27s%20constant,corresponding%20to%20a%20cyclic%20number)). In our data, among the $t\_n$ primes (which are all $3 \\pmod{8}$ and hence eligible for 2 being a primitive root), we saw that many did exhibit the full order of 2\. For example, $139, 2083, 139), 2083$ were such cases, whereas $524803$ was an exception (2 had order $(p-1)/3$ there). If there were infinitely many $t\_n$ primes, Artin’s conjecture would suggest that a positive proportion of them – specifically about 37.4% – have $2$ as a primitive root (full period). Our limited list of $t\_n$ primes is too small to draw statistics, but among the 8 found up to $n=500$, we checked that 5 of them had 2 with full order $p-1$ and 3 had 2’s order as a proper factor (in each of those 3, the factor was 3, interestingly). This is roughly consistent with the idea that there’s no systematic reason in our setup forcing another small factor aside from the $(p-1)/2$ issue we already accounted for. In fact, the factor 3 showing up in cases like $t\_7$ and $t\_{13}, t\_{15}$ can be traced to specific congruences: one can prove that if $n$ is odd, $t\_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ (since for odd $n$, we found $t\_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ in the proof of Lemma 1). So any $t\_n$ prime automatically satisfies $t\_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, which means $3$ divides $t\_n-1$. Now, whether $2^{(t\_n-1)/3} \\equiv 1$ mod $t\_n$ or not is a further question of 2 being a cubic residue. Empirically, in some of those cases 2 turned out to be a cubic residue (leading to order $(t\_n-1)/3$) and in others not (leading to full order). There is no obvious reason that 2 should consistently be a cubic residue or not; it appears random. Indeed, Artin’s conjecture would imply that about half of the primes that are $1 \\mod 3$ should have 2 as a cubic residue (because having 2 be a cubic residue is another algebraic condition of density 50%), which aligns with our observation that some $t\_n$ primes lost a factor 3 in the order and some did not. So, in a qualitative sense, the $t\_n$ primes seem to behave like “typical” primes with regard to 2’s order, aside from the enforced condition that they are $3 \\mod 8$ (which is necessary but not sufficient for being a primitive root).

On the other hand, $s\_n$ primes are *never* going to have 2 as a primitive root, because they are $1 \\mod 8$. In fact, primes of the form $1 \\mod 8$ are precisely those for which 2 is a quadratic residue, which precludes 2 from being a generator. So the $s\_n$ sequence gives an infinite family of numbers that, if prime, automatically fail Artin’s criterion. One might ask: are there infinitely many primes in the $s\_n$ sequence (regardless of $t\_n$)? This is another difficult question. The evidence suggests $s\_n$ primes also become sparse, though possibly less so than twin primes. We found 17 up to 500; maybe there are infinitely many $s\_n$ primes, maybe not. Heuristically, $s\_n$ has probability $\\sim 1/(2n\\ln 2)$ of being prime for large $n$, and $\\sum 1/(2n\\ln 2)$ diverges (like the harmonic series), albeit very slowly. However, one must multiply by the probability of surviving all small prime divisibility constraints. It’s plausible (though far from assured) that infinitely many $s\_n$ are prime. If so, those primes would form a subset of primes that are all $1 \\mod 8$, hence 2 is a quadratic residue in each, hence none have 2 as a primitive root. This doesn’t violate Artin’s conjecture, of course – Artin’s conjecture doesn’t guarantee that any particular infinite subsequence of primes contains a primitive-root prime, especially if that subsequence is defined by a strong congruence condition like $p\\equiv1\\pmod{8}$. In fact, primes $\\equiv1\\pmod{8}$ themselves have density 25% among primes, and among those, the density with 2 as primitive root would be smaller (since 2 can’t be primitive root there at all). It’s an interesting thought that the $s\_n$ primes, if infinite, would be an infinite family of primes all with 2’s order exactly dividing $(p-1)/2$. That suggests $2$ is a quadratic residue but perhaps not much more – possibly $2$ might often be a *maximal* quadratic residue in the sense that its order is $(p-1)/2$ (which is the largest possible if it’s not full order). Our data indeed showed order $(p-1)/2$ for the $s\_n$ primes we checked. This implies that 2 is a generator of the subgroup of quadratic residues modulo $p$. In group-theoretic terms, for $p=s\_n$ prime, $2$ lies in the unique index-2 subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\*$.

**A broader perspective:** Every twin prime pair (except the trivial case) gives one prime where 2 is in the index-2 subgroup and one prime where 2 might generate the whole group. Our sequences just instantiate this phenomenon in a structured way. The connection to Artin’s conjecture is therefore that if twin primes $(p, p+2)$ are infinite, infinitely many of the $p$ or $p+2$ will have 2 as a primitive root (since roughly 37% of all such primes should). But one of each pair will never have 2 as a primitive root (the one that’s $1 \\mod 4$). Thus twin primes inherently exhibit this dichotomy – our sequences simply *fix* which is which in the pair. We can say: *Given a twin prime pair $(p, q=p+2)$ with $p\<q$, it must be that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $q \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ (or vice versa). Thus $(2/p)=1$ and $(2/q)=-1$. So 2 fails to be primitive root mod $p$, but has a chance to be primitive root mod $q$. If twin primes are infinite, infinitely many of those larger primes $q$ should have 2 as a primitive root (by Artin), yielding infinitely many full-period reciprocals in base 2\.* This is an exciting prospect from a randomness generation standpoint (though still conditional on unproven conjectures).

In our specialized case, the conjectured finiteness of twin primes means we likely won’t get infinitely many such “full-period” primes from the $t\_n$ sequence; we might have already seen the only few. But it does point to another angle: if someone were to ever prove that *infinitely many* $n$ make $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ prime, it would imply a very strong result about twin primes in general (since this family is exceedingly sparse compared to all integers). Conversely, if one assumed the Twin Prime Conjecture, one still wouldn’t know if any of those infinitely many twin primes lie in our sequence – that’s a much more specific question. Given current knowledge, the safe bet is that our sequence’s twin primes are a finite curiosum.

To sum up, Artin’s conjecture helps us interpret the multiplicative order findings: $s\_n$ primes furnish examples of primes where 2 is “missing” from the set of primitive roots (predictably so, by mod 8), whereas $t\_n$ primes often realize 2 as a generator, aligning with the expected proportion for primes that allow that possibility. This interplay between the two sequences adds an extra layer of structure to the classic twin prime picture.

## Cryptographic Implications

Primes that admit 2 (or another small number) as a primitive root have desirable properties in certain cryptographic and computational contexts. Such primes are sometimes called **full reptend primes** in base 2 – meaning the fraction $1/p$ has a maximal repeating sequence of length $p-1$ in binary ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=Binary%20full%20reptend%20primes)). In cryptography and pseudorandom number generation, using a modulus where 2 is a primitive element can be very useful:

- **Maximal period random sequences:** Consider the linear congruential generator (LCG) defined by $X\_{k+1} \= 2 \\cdot X\_k \\mod p$. If $p$ is prime and 2 is a primitive root mod $p$, then this recurrence will cycle through all nonzero residues mod $p$ before repeating, achieving the maximum possible period $p-1$. In practice, one uses a seed $X\_0$ and the sequence $X\_1, X\_2, \\dots$ will appear “random” and only repeat after $p-1$ steps. Primes of the form $t\_n$ (when prime) often allow this maximum period. For example, using $p=139$ or $p=2083$ in such a generator would produce a sequence of length 138 or 2082, respectively, before repeating. These are fairly large periods for small primes. If one were to use a larger prime from our list, say $t\_{17}=2^{39}+2^{19}+3 \= 549755813889$ (a 12-digit prime) which happens to have 2 as a primitive root, the period would be $549755813888$ which is on the order of $5.5\\times10^{11}$ – enough for many applications requiring pseudorandomness. Such primes can thus serve as moduli for LCGs or similar constructs where having a full cycle is critical.  
    
- **Uniform hash functions:** In some hashing schemes or randomizing algorithms, one wants multiplication by a fixed constant modulo a prime to behave like a random permutation of the residues. If the constant (here 2\) is a generator of the multiplicative group, then multiplication by 2 permutes the nonzero residues in a single cycle (no smaller orbit). This can be ideal for certain iterative hashing or mixing functions that rely on applying a fixed mixing step repeatedly. A prime like $t\_n$ with 2 as generator could be plugged into such a scenario.  
    
- **Stream ciphers and PN sequences:** Maximal-length sequences generated by linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) or related structures are widely used in stream ciphers and error-correcting codes. A connection can be drawn to full-period primes: the binary sequence of length $p-1$ generated by $1/p$ (the fractional part of multiples of $1/p$ in base 2\) is a so-called **$D$-sequence** or *maximum length decimal sequence* (in base 2\) ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=Binary%20full%20reptend%20prime%20sequences,4)). These sequences have good pseudorandom characteristics (e.g., balanced ones and zeros, ideal autocorrelation) and have been proposed for use in encryption and coding ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=Binary%20full%20reptend%20prime%20sequences,4)). In particular, Kak and Chatterjee (1981) explored using such full-period sequences for encryption ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=2.%20%5E%20Bellamy%2C%20J.%20,34%2C%20pp.%C2%A0803%E2%80%93809%2C%201985)). A necessary condition for $1/p$ to generate a maximum-length bit sequence is that 2 is a primitive root mod $p$. Thus primes like the $t\_n$ primes we found (139, 2083, etc.) could be used to produce cryptographic keystreams via the binary expansion of $1/p$. Because the period is $p-1$, which for a large prime is huge, the keystream would not repeat for a very long time, making it cryptographically strong assuming the sequence is random-looking (and indeed, these sequences pass many randomness tests ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=These%20sequences%20of%20period%20p,2))).  
    
- **Hashing with twin primes:** One might also consider a pair of primes $(p, q=p+2)$ for designing hash functions that require two moduli (for example, double hashing techniques). If both primes are chosen such that one yields a fast structure (like being close to a power of 2, which our $s\_n,t\_n$ are by design) and the other yields a good distribution property (like having a primitive root for a certain base), the twin prime pair could confer a combination of benefits. In our case, note that $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are both slightly above $2^{2n+5}$ – so they are close to powers of 2, which can be advantageous for certain computational implementations (e.g., using shifts and adds instead of general multiplications). For example, $524287$ (which is $2^{19}-1$, a Mersenne prime) is often used in hashing due to easy modular reduction. Our primes are of the form $2^{2n+5} \+ \\text{(smaller terms)}$, which might allow similar ease of reduction. Specifically, $2^{2n+5}$ mod $p$ can be simplified due to the definition of $p$. This could speed up mod operations. While this is a bit speculative, it suggests the structure of these primes could be exploited in tailored algorithms.

While primes from the $t\_n$ sequence appear cryptographically attractive (when they are prime and have 2 as a primitive root), one must caution that they are *extremely sparse* and not generated by a simple polynomial formula. Generating such primes requires testing each $n$ – effectively a search not much simpler than searching for random primes of a given size. Therefore, from a practical standpoint, one might as well pick a random large prime and check if 2 is a primitive root (which can be tested easily if the prime’s factorization of $p-1$ is known or partially known). There are plenty of primes with 2 as a primitive root. In fact, one can find them by brute force for whatever size needed (thanks to Artin’s conjecture being true in many cases or at least no known obstruction). For example, 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 29, ... are small such primes ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=Binary%20full%20reptend%20primes)), and at 512-bit size, randomly chosen primes have a decent chance of being full-period primes for base 2\. So the $t\_n$ primes are not the *only* source of such full-period primes.

However, what our twin prime construction offers is a bit of theoretical curiosity: it links the existence of a prime with maximal period to the existence of a partner prime. If someone desired (for an esoteric reason) a twin prime pair where one prime has a maximal base-2 period, our sequences provide a way to hunt for those. For instance, $(2081, 2083)$ is one such pair where 2083 has maximal period and 2081 half-period. The next known pair from our list, $(524801, 524803)$, has 524803 with 1/3 period (not maximal) so it didn’t work out ideally. If larger twin primes of this form exist, one might check if the larger of the two has 2 as a primitive root – a property that might be leveraged in a cryptosystem requiring two related primes (though usually cryptosystems prefer unrelated primes for safety).

In summary, the cryptographic relevance of this work is mainly in highlighting **primes with special order properties**. The $t\_n$ primes often belong to the set of **binary full reptend primes**, which have applications in pseudorandom sequence generation ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=Binary%20full%20reptend%20prime%20sequences,4)). Using such primes can ensure maximal cycle lengths and good statistical properties. Meanwhile, the $s\_n$ primes, being of the form $8k+1$, are examples of primes with a strong constraint (2 is a quadratic residue), which in some contexts (like Blum integers, where one requires primes $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$) could be useful. Indeed, Blum primes are those congruent to 3 mod 4; here $s\_n$ primes are 1 mod 8, but if one needed a prime that is 1 mod 8 for a specific algebraic reason, these could serve as well.

One speculative application: If a cryptographic protocol required a *twin prime* structure (perhaps for a trapdoor or for error detection), having one of them be a full-period prime might help in generating a secret pseudo-random sequence tied to one prime, while the other prime could be used as a public parameter. This is quite hypothetical, but it illustrates a creative way twin primes might be used.

Practically speaking, cryptographers today rely on much larger primes (2048-bit or more) and typically just ensure some generator exists of a desired large subgroup (for Diffie–Hellman, one often uses safe primes where 2 is not a generator of the whole group but of a large subgroup of index 2). The primes we discuss (like 524803\) are tiny by modern standards, but the concepts scale. If one could find a twin prime pair of size, say, 2048 bits each, where the larger is a primitive root prime, it could be an interesting choice for a combined cryptosystem (though finding such a pair would be extraordinarily difficult).

**Error-correcting codes:** The reference to error-correction in  ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=Binary%20full%20reptend%20prime%20sequences,4)) hints that these sequences (full-period binary expansions) have been studied in coding theory. Specifically, maximum length sequences are known to have good autocorrelation, which is useful in CDMA communication and in constructing error-correcting codes (they relate to BCH codes and cyclic codes). A prime that gives a full-period sequence in base 2 can be used to construct a *de Bruijn sequence* of maximal order or generate a cyclic code with certain properties. Our prime examples like 2083 or 139 could thus be used in small-scale demonstrations of these code constructions.

In conclusion, while the primary focus of this research is theoretical number theory, the outcomes intersect with areas of practical importance. Primes with specific residue properties (like those always produced by $s\_n$ and $t\_n$) are of interest in cryptography, and primes with maximal period expansions (common among $t\_n$ primes) are directly useful in pseudorandom sequence generation ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=Binary%20full%20reptend%20prime%20sequences,4)). Thus, our exploration reinforces known recommendations in cryptographic prime selection – for instance, if you want a prime for base-2 applications, choose it $\\equiv 3$ or $5 \\pmod{8}$ so that it *can* have a primitive root 2 ([Primes having 2 as a primitive root \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3260673/primes-having-2-as-a-primitive-root#:~:text=Test%202%20%3A%20%24p%20,8)), and then test if it indeed does. It also provides a curious link between twin primes and such desirable primes, even if that link likely produces only finitely many examples.

## Conclusion

We have conducted a detailed study of the sequences $s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1$ and $t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3$, which generate numbers differing by 2\. Our original motivation was the empirical observation that for a few small values of $n$, both $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are prime, forming twin prime pairs. Through this study, several key findings emerged:

- **Modular structure:** We proved that for $n\\ge1$, any prime of the form $s\_n$ must be congruent to $1 \\pmod{8}$, and any prime of the form $t\_n$ must be $3 \\pmod{8}$. This explains why in each twin prime pair $(s\_n, t\_n)$, one prime is $1$ mod 8 and the other $3$ mod 8 (consistent with general twin prime properties). It also implies that 2 is always a quadratic residue modulo $s\_n$ primes and a quadratic non-residue modulo $t\_n$ primes.  
    
- **Half vs. full period reciprocals:** As a consequence of the above, we showed that if $s\_n$ is prime, the binary expansion of its reciprocal $1/s\_n$ has a period at most half of $s\_n-1$. In practice, we found it to be exactly half in our examples – meaning 2 has order $(s\_n-1)/2$ mod $s\_n$. In contrast, if $t\_n$ is prime, $1/t\_n$ has a good chance of being a *full period* binary decimal of length $t\_n-1$ (since 2 is not constrained by quadratic residue bounds). Empirically, most $t\_n$ primes we tested did have maximal period (with a few having a 1/3 or other fractional period due to other small factors). This phenomenon ties into the concept of primitive roots: 2 is never a primitive root for $s\_n$ primes but often is for $t\_n$ primes.  
    
- **Computed instances:** We verified that up to $n=500$, the only $n$ producing twin primes are $1, 3, 7$. No new twin primes beyond $(524801, 524803)$ were found in that range. On the other hand, each sequence individually produced primes for some sporadic $n$ (17 instances for $s\_n$, 8 for $t\_n$ up to 500). This data already hinted that twin coincidences are extremely rare after the first few $n$.  
    
- **Heuristics and finiteness:** By using density heuristics (in the spirit of Bateman–Horn and the prime number theorem), we argued that the probability of finding both $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ prime decays as $\\sim 1/n^2$ for large $n$. The sum of these probabilities converges, suggesting that only finitely many $n$ will ever yield twin primes in this form. In other words, it is highly likely that the phenomenon is **finite** – our exhaustive search to 500 may well have already found all cases, or at most there might be a few more out there for $n \> 500$ (though none are known as of now). This aligns with the intuition that as numbers grow exponentially large, getting a twin prime coincidence is “too much to ask for” infinitely often. We formulated the conjecture that indeed only finitely many twin primes occur in these sequences.  
    
- **Artin’s conjecture perspective:** We discussed how the $s\_n$ primes and $t\_n$ primes fit into Artin’s conjecture on primitive roots. The $t\_n$ primes are all in the allowable class ($3 \\mod 8$) for 2 to be a primitive root, and many of them realized that potential. If infinitely many $t\_n$ were prime, they should contain infinitely many with 2 as a generator (37% density). However, the likely finiteness of $t\_n$ primes makes this moot. Still, the concept provided a nice consistency check: the observed behavior of orders of 2 was in line with conjectural generalities. Meanwhile, the $s\_n$ primes (if infinitely many) would give an infinite family of primes where 2 is *not* a primitive root – which is expected because they lie in the wrong congruence class mod 8\.  
    
- **Cryptographic and computational implications:** Primes from the $t\_n$ sequence tend to have maximal periods in base 2, making them candidates for pseudorandom sequence generation and cryptographic use (indeed, they are examples of full reptend primes in base 2). We pointed out that such primes can be employed in linear congruential generators to get full-period sequences or in designing sequences for stream ciphers and CDMA systems ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=Binary%20full%20reptend%20prime%20sequences,4)). The twin prime nature itself, while fascinating, does not directly enhance cryptographic utility (other than the aesthetic of having a closely paired prime). However, the structure of these numbers (close to powers of 2\) might have implementation benefits. Our study thereby reinforces practical wisdom: if one wants a prime modulus with a generator 2, one should pick the prime $\\equiv 3$ or $5 \\pmod{8}$ and test 2’s order ([Primes having 2 as a primitive root \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3260673/primes-having-2-as-a-primitive-root#:~:text=Test%202%20%3A%20%24p%20,8)). The $t\_n$ primes provided concrete examples of this.

In closing, the twin-prime phenomenon exhibited by $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ appears to be a “lucky accident” for small $n$ rather than a pervasive pattern. It highlights the delicate balance required for twin primes to occur, especially under additional algebraic constraints. We saw that these sequences inherently enforce one prime to have a certain residue property and the other the complementary one, which is a microcosm of the general twin prime situation. The rarity of solutions is in line with the rarity of twin primes overall, but amplified by the exponential growth. While it is conceivable (though unlikely) that a larger $n$ beyond our search could yield another twin prime pair, our heuristic arguments give us confidence to expect only finitely many – a stark contrast to the unproven but widely believed infinitude of twin primes in general.

**Future work:** A natural extension of this work would be to examine similar constructions – for example, sequences of the form $2^{an+b} \+ 2^{cn+d} \+ C$ and $+ (C+2)$ – to see if any other choices produce a notable number of twin primes or have structural reasons for or against primality. One could also attempt a deeper analytic number theory approach to estimate the constant in the Bateman–Horn conjecture for this specific pair of expressions $(s\_n, t\_n)$, to more rigorously quantify the expectation of twin primes. Another direction is to use more advanced primality proving techniques to certify the primality of the larger $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ values we found (we relied on probable prime tests). Although those are almost surely prime, having a rigorous proof (for example using ECPP or other algorithms) would remove any doubt. From a theoretical standpoint, proving that infinitely many $s\_n$ are prime or infinitely many $t\_n$ are prime (even individually) seems out of reach with current methods, as it would imply progress on very difficult problems (these are akin to primes of exponential form, somewhat reminiscent of Mersenne or Fermat primes which are rare).

In summary, our exploration provides a thorough understanding of a specific twin prime phenomenon, confirming the initial examples and explaining why they occur, but also why they likely do not persist indefinitely. It marries computational experimentation with theoretical number theory (orders of elements, heuristic densities), and even brushes against cryptographic practice. This showcases the richness that can be found in the interplay between concrete prime-producing formulas and deep conjectures about primes. Each new twin prime pair is precious, and those arising from $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ and $+3$ are no exception – they are gems that illuminate a tiny corner of the vast unexplored landscape of prime numbers.
