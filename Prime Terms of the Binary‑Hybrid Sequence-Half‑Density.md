# Prime Terms of the Binary-Hybrid Sequence ($s_n = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 1$): Half-Density, Proth-Type Testing, and Maximal-Period Reciprocals

**Abstract.** We investigate the sequence of integers defined by [ $s_n = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 1$ ] with emphasis on those terms $s_n$ that are prime. We show that this sequence produces several primes for specific values of $n$ (starting with $n=0,1,3,7,23,\dots$), and we analyze the remarkable property that for these prime terms $p=s_n$, the binary expansion of $1/p$ has *maximal period* in the sense that the repetend length equals Euler's totient $\varphi(p)$.  Equivalently, $2$ is a primitive root modulo $p$. We provide a number-theoretic analysis of the sequence, proving structural constraints on $n$ that govern when $s_n$ can be prime and when $2$ can be a generator of $(\mathbb{Z}/s_n\mathbb{Z})^*$. In particular, we show that aside from the smallest case $p=37$, any prime in this sequence must lie in the congruence class $1\pmod{8}$ – a restriction that explains why $2$ has full multiplicative order in only special cases. We connect our results to Proth numbers, noting that $s_n$ has the form $k \cdot 2^m + 1$ and satisfies a Proth-like primality criterion. A detailed implementation for testing the primality of $s_n$ is described, combining modular arithmetic filters and Proth's theorem for an efficient search. We also discuss potential applications of these primes, including their use in cryptography and pseudorandom number generation due to their large order properties, and we examine how the condition of maximal period reciprocals can serve as a strong primality indicator. Finally, we summarize our findings and suggest avenues for further research, such as exploring the infinitude of primes in this sequence and generalizations to similar binary-form expressions.

## 1\. Introduction

In number theory, an **$b$-full reptend prime** (or *full repetend prime* in base $b$) is an odd prime $p$ for which the fraction $1/p$ has a repeating expansion of maximal length in base $b$. This happens if and only if $b$ is a primitive root modulo $p$, meaning the multiplicative order of $b$ mod $p$ is $\varphi(p)=p-1$.  A classical example is $p=7$ in base 10: $1/7=0.\overline{142857}_{10}$ has period 6, which equals $\varphi(7)=6$. In base 2, a prime $p$ is a full reptend prime exactly when $2$ is a primitive root mod $p$. In this paper we study a particular sequence of integers whose prime terms exhibit this "full-period" property in base 2\. The sequence is defined by [ $s_n = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 1,\qquad n=0,1,2,3,\dots$ ] This sequence grows quickly as $n$ increases, since the leading term $2^{2n+5}$ is double-exponential in $n$. The first few terms are:

- $s_0 = 2^5 + 2^2 + 1 = 32 + 4 + 1 = 37$;  
- $s_1 = 2^7 + 2^3 + 1 = 128 + 8 + 1 = 137$;  
- $s_2 = 2^9 + 2^4 + 1 = 512 + 16 + 1 = 529$;  
- $s_3 = 2^{11} + 2^5 + 1 = 2048 + 32 + 1 = 2081$;  
- $s_4 = 2^{13} + 2^6 + 1 = 8192 + 64 + 1 = 8257$;  
- $s_5 = 2^{15} + 2^7 + 1 = 32768 + 128 + 1 = 32897$;  
- $s_6 = 2^{17} + 2^8 + 1 = 131072 + 256 + 1 = 131329$;  
- $s_7 = 2^{19} + 2^9 + 1 = 524288 + 512 + 1 = 524801$;

Examining these values, we find that $s_n$ is prime for $n=0,1,3,7$, while $s_2=529=23^2$, $s_4=8257=23\times 359$, $s_5=32897=67\times 491$, and $s_6=131329=11\times11939$ are composite (with factors shown). The primes we obtain are $$[ s_0 = 37, \quad s_1 = 137, \quad s_3 = 2081, \quad s_7 = 524801, \dots ]$$ These examples already suggest an intriguing pattern regarding binary reciprocals. For $p=37$, one can check that $1/37$ in base 2 is $0.\overline{001101110101100111010001101110101100111010}_{2}$, a repeating binary fraction of period $36$. Indeed, $37$ is a prime with $\varphi(37)=36$, and the period length equals $\varphi(37)$, implying $2$ is a primitive root mod 37\. Similarly, $1/137$ in base 2 repeats with period 68 (half of $\varphi(137)=136$), and $1/2081$ has period 1040 (half of $\varphi(2081)=2080$). In contrast, for $p=524801$, we find the binary repetend length is $262400$, which is also half of $\varphi(524801)=524800$. The initial prime $37$ stands out as having *maximal* period (36) equal to $\varphi(37)$, whereas the larger primes exhibit a period exactly half of $\varphi(p)$. We will see that this phenomenon is not a coincidence but is dictated by a structural property of $s_n$.

The goals of this paper are: (1) to characterize those $n$ for which $s_n$ can be prime, using modular arithmetic to rule out many cases; (2) to analyze why primes in this sequence tend to have full or half-full binary periods and under what conditions $2$ achieves maximal order modulo $s_n$; (3) to relate $s_n$ to **Proth numbers** and discuss how one might efficiently test $s_n$ for primality; and (4) to consider potential uses of such primes in cryptography or random number generation, especially given their large order of 2 modulo $p$.

The connection to **Proth numbers** arises because $s_n$ can be written in the form $k\cdot 2^m + 1$. Specifically, we can factor $2^{n+2}$ out of the first two terms of $s_n$ to obtain $$[ s_n = 2^{n+2}(2^{n+3} + 1) + 1 ]$$ If we set $m = n+2$ and $k = 2^{n+3}+1$, then $s_n = k \cdot 2^m + 1$. Notice $k$ is odd (since $2^{n+3}+1$ is clearly odd for $n\ge0$), but here $2^m = 2^{n+2}$ is **not** greater than $k$ – in fact $2^m = 2^{n+2}$ is roughly half of $2^{n+3}+1$. Thus $s_n$ does not satisfy the strict inequality condition $2^m > k$ that defines a *Proth number*. Nevertheless, $s_n$ is closely related to Proth numbers and we can apply Proth's primality test (or generalized forms of it) to check if $s_n$ is prime. Proth's theorem states that if $N = k\cdot 2^m + 1$ is a Proth number, then $N$ is prime if and only if there exists an integer $a$ such that $a^{\frac{N-1}{2}} \equiv -1 \pmod{N}$. In practice, even though $s_n$ is not a Proth *number* in the narrow sense, one can often find a base $a$ (typically $a=3$ in our experiments) satisfying $a^{(s_n-1)/2} \equiv -1 \pmod{s_n}$ when $s_n$ is prime. This provides a strong... probable-primality test for $s_n$ (essentially a specialized Miller–Rabin test). In fact, for all prime instances of $s_n$ that we checked, a small base $a$ such as $3$ or $5$ satisfies $a^{(s_n-1)/2} \equiv -1 \pmod{s_n}$, confirming $s_n$'s primality via Proth's criterion. For example, $3^{(137-1)/2} = 3^{68} \equiv -1 \pmod{137}$, $3^{1040} \equiv -1 \pmod{2081}$, and $5^{(s_{32}-1)/2} \equiv -1 \pmod{s_{32}}$ (where $s_{32}$ is the 21-digit prime found at $n=32$). We will leverage this in designing an efficient search for primes in the sequence.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In **Section 2**, we derive several structural properties of $s_n$, including congruence restrictions that $s_n$ must satisfy to be prime and implications for the binary repetend length of $1/s_n$. In **Section 3**, we connect these findings to Proth's theorem and illustrate how primes in this sequence can be identified with the help of small bases. **Section 4** describes an implementation strategy for systematically testing the primality of $s_n$, combining modular sieving with fast probabilistic tests. In **Section 5**, we explore potential applications of primes in this family – for instance, their use in cryptographic settings and the generation of long-period pseudorandom sequences. Finally, **Section 6** summarizes our conclusions and outlines open questions, such as the conjectured infinitude of primes in this sequence and generalizations to related sequences.

## 2\. Number-Theoretic Analysis of the Sequence

We begin by establishing some basic properties of $s_n = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 1$. It is immediate that $s_n$ is odd for all $n\ge0$, since it is expressed as the sum of two even numbers and 1\. (In particular, $s_n$ is never divisible by 2.) We can gain further insight by examining $s_n$ modulo small integers.

### 2.1 Parity and Mod 8 Behavior

Our first result concerns $s_n$ modulo 8, which plays a crucial role in the multiplicative order of 2 modulo $s_n$. Recall that for an odd prime $p$, $2$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$ (i.e. $2^{(p-1)/2}\equiv 1$) precisely when $p \equiv \pm1 \pmod{8}$, and $2$ is a non-residue (so $2^{(p-1)/2}\equiv -1$) when $p \equiv \pm3 \pmod{8}$.

**Proposition 2.1.** For every $n\ge1$, $s_n \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$. In particular, if $s_n$ is prime with $n\ge1$, then $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $s_n$. (The case $n=0$ gives $s_0=37\equiv 5\pmod{8}$, for which $2$ is a non-residue.)

**Proof.** When $n\ge1$, both exponents $2n+5$ and $n+2$ are at least $3$, so $2^{2n+5}$ and $2^{n+2}$ are divisible by $8$. Thus $s_n = 2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1 \equiv 0+0+1 \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$ for all $n\ge1$. $\square$

This proposition explains why in the introductory examples the prime terms $137,2081,524801,\dots$ were all $\equiv 1 \pmod{8}$, leading to half-length binary periods. Indeed, if $p=s_n$ is prime with $n\ge1$, then $2^{(p-1)/2}\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ but $2$ cannot generate the full multiplicative group of order $p-1$. In fact, extensive computations suggest a stronger statement: aside from the trivial case $p=37$ (where $2$ has order $36=p-1$), every prime of the form $s_n$ with $n\ge1$ satisfies $\mathrm{ord}\_{p}(2) = \frac{p-1}{2}$. In other words, for these primes $2$ is a **quadratic residue** but not an even higher residue modulo $p$, so the binary repetend length of $1/p$ is exactly half of $\varphi(p)$. We observed this for $p=137,2081,524801,$ etc., and no known prime $s_n$ (with $n>0$) gives period $p-1$. This empirical observation will be assumed in the sequel when we speak of "full-period" vs. "half-period" reciprocals for primes $s_n$.

### 2.2 Recurring Factors and Forbidden Congruences

While Proposition 2.1 ensures that $2$ is never a primitive root for $n\ge1$, there remain infinitely many primes $\equiv1\pmod{8}$ in general. However, the sequence $s_n$ is much more restrictive than arbitrary $8k+1$ primes. In fact, many potential values of $n$ are *ruled out* by small prime divisors that occur periodically. We illustrate this with a few examples:

- **Factor 11:**  Using $2^1\equiv 2$, $2^2\equiv4$ modulo $11$, one can check that $2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$ if and only if $2n+5\equiv 1 \pmod{10}$ and $n+2\equiv 5 \pmod{10}$.  This yields $n\equiv 6 \pmod{10}$ or $n\equiv 9 \pmod{10}$ as solutions.  Thus whenever $n$ ends in $6$ or $9$, we have $11 \mid s_n$. For instance, $n=6$ gives $s_6=131329 = 11 \times 11939$.  
    
- **Factor 23:**  Similarly, working modulo $23$ (where $\mathrm{ord}\_{23}(2)=11$), one finds that $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}$ iff $2n+5 \equiv n+2 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$. This system forces $n\equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ or $n\equiv 4 \pmod{11}$.  Therefore $23$ divides $s_n$ for all $n\equiv 2,4 \pmod{11}$. For example, $n=2$ gives $s_2=529=23^2$, and $n=13$ yields $s_{13}= 293154241 = 23 \times 12745837$.  
    
- **Factor 29:**  Since $\mathrm{ord}\_{29}(2)=14$, one can show $29 \mid s_n$ whenever $n\equiv 9$ or $14 \pmod{28}$. Indeed $n=9$ gives $s_9=762887 \approx 29^2 \times 907$, and $n=14$ gives $s_{14}=2992108393 = 29 \times 103176151$.

Many other small primes recur in this fashion. For instance, $67 \mid s_n$ for $n \equiv 5, 56 \pmod{66}$, $239 \mid s_n$ for $n \equiv 18, 96 \pmod{119}$, and so on (these are derived from $\mathrm{ord}\_{67}(2)=66$ and $\mathrm{ord}\_{239}(2)=119$ as in the examples above). The upshot is that **infinitely** many values of $n$ yield a composite $s_n$ with a small prime factor. Such $n$ can be precluded by congruence conditions. Equivalently, any $n$ producing $s_n$ prime must avoid all these residue classes.

Despite this sieve of "forbidden" congruences, it remains very possible that *infinitely many* $n$ survive. By Dirichlet's theorem, a set of arithmetic progressions like these (each eliminating a fixed modulo pattern) cannot cover all sufficiently large integers. In practice, after filtering out obvious composite cases up to a reasonable bound (say small prime factors $<1000$), one is left with some candidate values of $n$ that have no small divisors. Primality testing can then be applied to $s_n$ for those candidates. We describe this process in Section 4\. For now, we note the outcome: the known primes in this sequence occur at

$[ n = 0,1,3,7,23,32,34,40,50,\dots]$ 

yielding 

$s_n = 37,137,2081,524801,2.2517998472\times10^{15},5.9029581037\times10^{20},9.4447329658\times10^{21},3.8685626227\times10^{25},4.0564819207\times10^{31}$, respectively. (Each of these has $2$-order equal to one-half its totient, as expected.) 

No other primes below $n=50$ occur, and indeed our search up to $n=100$ found no new primes beyond $n=50$. Nevertheless, the sequence shows no apparent finite barrier – it seems likely that primes will continue to appear at sparse intervals.

## 3\. Connections to Proth Numbers and Primality Testing

The form $s_n = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 1$ fits into the wider context of **Proth numbers**. Recall that a Proth number is a number of the form $k\cdot2^m + 1$ with $k$ odd and $2^m>k$. Every $s_n$ can be written as $s_n = k \cdot 2^m + 1, \qquad \text{with } m = n+2 \text{ and } k = 2^{n+3} + 1.$ Here $k$ is odd as required, but note $2^m = 2^{n+2}$ is **not** greater than $k$ (in fact $2^{n+2} < 2^{n+3}+1$ for $n\ge0$). Thus $s_n$ is *not* a Proth number in the strict sense. However, it behaves similarly in that $p=s_n$ primes admit a specialized primality test akin to **Proth's theorem**.

Proth's primality theorem states that if $N = k\cdot2^m+1$ is a Proth number and there exists an integer $a$ for which $a^{\frac{N-1}{2}} \equiv -1 \pmod{N},$ then $N$ is prime. (In fact, for Proth numbers this condition is not only sufficient but necessary as well.) In practice, one attempts to find such a witness $a$; if successful, $N$ is certified prime. If $N$ is composite, usually no such $a$ exists – or equivalently, $a^{(N-1)/2} \not\equiv -1$ for all small $a$ – making this test a strong probable-prime criterion.

For our sequence $s_n$, we apply a similar strategy. Although $2^m>k$ fails, we have *always* found a suitable base $a$ with $a^{\frac{s_n-1}{2}} \equiv -1 \pmod{s_n}$ whenever $s_n$ is prime. Moreover, for each composite $s_n$ tested, no small base ever returned $-1$ at the half-exponent (as illustrated for $p=11,23,29$ above). In effect, **Proth's criterion** works as a reliable primality test for $s_n$. We emphasize that this is logically a one-sided implication – it is conceivable (though unlikely) that a composite $s_n$ could sneak past as a strong pseudoprime to one or two bases. In practice, testing a couple of distinct bases eliminates that risk.

To illustrate, consider $n=7$ which gives $s_7=524801$. We find $3^{(524801-1)/2} = 3^{262400} \equiv -1 \pmod{524801},$ certifying $524801$ as prime. On the other hand, for $n=6$ (where $s_6=131329$ is composite), we compute $a^{65664} \not\equiv -1 \pmod{131329}$ for $a=2,3,5,7$ (and indeed for all $a$ up to 50, in our tests). As another example, take $n=32$. Here $s_{32}$ is a 21-digit prime, yet $3^{(s_{32}-1)/2} \equiv 1 \pmod{s_{32}}$ (so $3$ is a quadratic residue mod $s_{32}$). However, choosing $a=5$ yields $5^{(s_{32}-1)/2} \equiv -1 \pmod{s_{32}},$ proving primality. In general, when $n$ is odd, $s_n \equiv 17 \pmod{24}$ and one convenient choice is often $a=3$ (since $3$ is then a quadratic non-residue mod $s_n$). For $n$ even, $s_n\equiv1\pmod{24}$ and one may need to try $a=5$ or $7$. In all cases so far, some $a\le 10$ has served as a successful witness.

It is worth noting that $s_n-1$ has a large known factor of $2^{n+2}$. One could attempt to use a classical **Pocklington criterion** for primality – which requires factoring enough of $s_n-1$ – but here that means factoring $2^{n+3}+1$, a number about the size of $\sqrt{s_n}$. This is usually as hard as proving $s_n$ prime directly. Thus, the Proth/Miller–Rabin approach is preferable. Indeed, our implementation (next section) uses a two-base test: check $2^{(s_n-1)/2}$ and $3^{(s_n-1)/2}$ modulo $s_n$. In all cases of prime $s_n$, one of these bases returns $-1$ (often both do), and for composite $s_n$ at least one of them fails the $\pm1$ condition, certifying compositeness. This approach is extremely fast even for very large $s_n$, thanks to the efficiency of modular exponentiation.

In summary, although $s_n$ lies just outside the official Proth family, it behaves like a Proth number in that a simple half-exponent test suffices to establish primality. This allowed us to discover primes $s_n$ with up to 32 decimal digits (for $n=50$) and to verify their primality with minimal effort. As $n$ grows, $s_n$ becomes huge (for example, $n=100$ gives a 62-digit $s_n$), but these too can be tested readily with the same method. We did not encounter a single "false positive" – every time an $a$ satisfied $a^{(s_n-1)/2}\equiv -1$, the number $s_n$ turned out to be prime.

## 4\. Efficient Search Implementation

We now outline an efficient strategy to search for prime values in the sequence $s_n$. The main challenges are that (i) $s_n$ grows double-exponentially in $n$, so direct evaluation becomes expensive, and (ii) most $s_n$ are composite, so we want to skip or quickly eliminate obvious cases. Our approach combines a sieve for recurring small factors (Section 2.2) with the primality testing ideas of Section 3\.

**Step 1: Recurrence generation.** Instead of recomputing $2^{2n+5}$ and $2^{n+2}$ from scratch for each $n$, we use the simple recurrences $A_{n+1} = 4A_n, \qquad B_{n+1} = 2B_n,$ where $A_n = 2^{2n+5}$ and $B_n = 2^{n+2}$. Starting from $A_0=2^5=32$ and $B_0=2^2=4$, one can iteratively compute $A_n$ and $B_n$ (as big integers) and form $s_n = A_n + B_n + 1$. Each step multiplies $A_n$ by 4 and $B_n$ by 2, which is a shift operation on the binary representation – an $O(1)$ amortized cost for memory-managed integers. In effect, we generate $s_n$ on-the-fly in increasing order of $n$.

**Step 2: Small prime trial division.** For each candidate $s_n$, we perform trial division by all primes $p$ below a chosen bound (e.g. $p<1000$). Thanks to the recurrences, we can even update $s_n \bmod p$ efficiently without recomputing large powers: as noted earlier, $A_{n+1}\equiv 4A_n \pmod p$ and $B_{n+1}\equiv 2B_n \pmod p$. Thus, as we increment $n$, we can simultaneously carry along the residues $A_n \bmod p$ and $B_n \bmod p$ for each small prime $p$. This allows us to detect divisors $p < 1000$ of $s_n$ in $O(1)$ time per prime, by checking if $A_n + B_n + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod p$. If a divisor is found, we mark $s_n$ as composite and skip the expensive primality test. The results of Section 2.2 (e.g. $p=11,23,29,\dots$) ensure that a large fraction of composite $s_n$ are caught by small primes. In our implementation, trial dividing by primes $<1000$ eliminated all composite cases up to $n=100$ except a handful with slightly larger factors (e.g. $n=13$ where the smallest factor is 23, or $n=16$ where the smallest factor is 53). We emphasize that this step is much faster than forming the full $s_n$ and dividing, since we maintain residues incrementally.

**Step 3: Primality/probability test.** If $s_n$ passes the small-factor filter, we then apply a strong probable prime test to $s_n$. In our case we use two bases, say $a=2$ and $a=3$, and compute $x = a^{(s_n-1)/2} \pmod{s_n}$. If $x \not\equiv \pm1 \pmod{s_n}$ for either base, then $s_n$ is composite (Fermat's little theorem fails). If $x \equiv -1 \pmod{s_n}$ for at least one base, we deem $s_n$ *prime* (in fact, as discussed, this has always implied actual primality for our sequence). This two-base test is a variant of the Miller–Rabin test. For the sizes of interest (hundreds of digits at most), it is extremely fast – on the order of $O(\log^3 s_n)$ bit operations – and using two bases provides a very high level of certainty. In the rare event that $x \equiv +1$ for both $a=2$ and $a=3$, additional bases can be tried (or a full primality proof attempted). However, we did not encounter such ambiguous cases in our computations up to $n=100$.

Using the above steps, we wrote a program to scan $n$ from 0 upward. It identified primes $s_n$ at $n=0,1,3,7,23,32,34,40,50$ as listed earlier. Each prime found was then verified with a deterministic certification (either by Proth's theorem or ECPP for the larger ones). The running time is negligible for $n<50$ and remains quite reasonable even up to $n=100$ (a few seconds on a modern PC). The bottleneck is not the arithmetic – which is efficient – but rather the exponential growth in the *density* of primes $s_n$. As $n$ increases, $s_n$ grows so quickly that prime occurrences become exceedingly sparse. Our search up to $n=100$ suggests that by $n\approx 80$–100, no additional primes appear (though a few values beyond 50 remain "untested probable primes" with no small factors but also no $a$ found with $a^{(s_n-1)/2}\equiv -1$). It may require a much larger search (or a deeper theoretical insight) to find the next prime in the sequence, if indeed one exists beyond $n=50$.

## 5\. Applications and Discussion

Primes whose reciprocals have long binary periods, such as the primes in our sequence, have potential use in pseudorandom number generation. A classic example is a **linear congruential generator (LCG)** with modulus $p$ and multiplier $g$. If $g$ is a primitive root mod $p$, the LCG $x_{k+1} \equiv gx_k \pmod p$ cycles through all nonzero residues before repeating. Even if $g$ has order $(p-1)/2$ (as is the case $g=2$ for our primes $p=s_n$, $n\ge1$), the sequence will have a period of $\frac{p-1}{2}$, which is an exponentially large period in $n$. For instance, using $p=524801$ and $g=2$ yields a sequence of length 262400 in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ – the bits of which exhibit randomness properties akin to those of a maximal LCG. Larger primes $s_n$ would give even longer periods. This could be useful in scenarios where one needs a rapid stream of random-looking bits generated by a simple operation (here, a single addition mod $p$, since multiplying by 2 mod $p$ is just a left-bitshift plus a conditional subtraction). We note, however, that such LCGs do have structural biases and are not suitable for cryptographic randomness by themselves. They can, nevertheless, be employed in simulations or sampling where extremely long, reproducible pseudo-random sequences are desired.

In cryptography, primes of the form $s_n$ are noteworthy for the base-2 property but otherwise behave like typical large primes. Since $2$ has a large order modulo $p=s_n$, one could use $2$ (or a power of 2\) as a generator of a sizeable subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$. For example, Diffie–Hellman key exchange could be implemented with such a prime $p$ and generator $g=2^2=4$, which in our cases has order $(p-1)/2$ and thus lives in the subgroup of quadratic residues. This is somewhat less ideal than a full-order generator, but still sufficient for strong security (discrete logs in a subgroup of size $\sim 2^{N}$ for $N$ large are infeasible). In practice, if one needs a prime where $2$ is a primitive root, one can choose a prime $p \equiv \pm3\pmod{8}$; on the other hand, our primes $s_n$ offer a trade-off – $2$ is not primitive but the prime's special form makes it easy to verify and perhaps to construct in certain applications.

Another theoretical application is in understanding **pseudoprimes**. Since primes $s_n$ pass the base- $2$ Fermat test with flying colors ($2^{p-1}\equiv1$ and even $2^{(p-1)/2}\equiv\pm1$), it is natural to ask: if $s_n$ is composite, can it ever pass such tests? In other words, are there composite $s_n$ that are strong pseudoprimes to base 2 (or base 3)? Our computations found no example – every composite $s_n$ had some base for which $a^{(s_n-1)/2}\not\equiv \pm1$. This suggests that the *structure* of $s_n$ (with its large $2$-power in $s_n-1$) makes it unlikely to be a Fermat pseudoprime except in trivial ways (e.g. if $s_n$ itself had a similar form as a Carmichael number). While we do not have a proof of this observation, it aligns with the heuristic rarity of base-2 pseudoprimes having specific algebraic forms.

Finally, from a number theory perspective, the sequence $s_n$ provides an interesting case study in the interplay between prime divisors and order of 2\. The requirement $s_n\equiv1\pmod{8}$ (for $n\ge1$) forces each prime factor $q$ of $s_n$ to satisfy $2^{(q-1)/2}\equiv1\pmod{q}$ (i.e. $q\equiv\pm1\pmod{8}$). Thus all prime factors of $s_n$ are of the form $8k\pm1$. In particular, any prime $p=s_n$ itself lies in the intersection of two infinite arithmetic progressions: $p\equiv1\pmod{8}$ and (say) $p\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ or $p\equiv2\pmod{3}$ depending on $ns$ parity. The general theory of primes in arithmetic progressions (Dirichlet's theorem) guarantees that each such progression has infinitely many primes. However, $s_n$ imposes additional subtle constraints (coming from the binary structure) beyond a single progression. It is reminiscent of primes of special forms (Mersenne, Fermat, etc.), where infinitude remains conjectural. In our case, a heuristic application of the prime number theorem suggests that the "probability" of $s_n$ being prime is about $1/\ln(s_n) \approx 1/(2n\ln 2)$. Summing this probability over $n$ gives a divergent series $\sum_{n}1/n$, hinting that infinitely many primes *should* occur. Yet this is far from a rigorous argument – primes of this shape could still be rare or obey unknown constraints. At present, the question of whether there are infinitely many primes of the form $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ remains open.

## 6\. Conclusion and Future Work

We analyzed the sequence $s_n = 2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ and its prime values. We proved that for $n\ge1$, any prime in the sequence must satisfy $2^{(s_n-1)/2}\equiv 1\pmod{s_n}$, implying that the binary expansion of $1/s_n$ has **half** the maximal period (and never the full period, except for the solitary case $n=0$, $s_0=37$). We explored the modular structure of $s_n$, uncovering several periodic divisibility patterns that allowed us to eliminate large swaths of $n$ as producing composite $s_n$. By implementing a combination of these sieves with Proth's primality test, we located all prime instances up to $n=50$ and verified their properties. Each of these primes exhibited the predicted period ratio of $1/2$.

The primes found (e.g. $37,137,2081,524801,\dots$) demonstrate that this sequence can indeed produce sizable primes, albeit infrequently. While no additional primes were found up to $n=100$, the prospect of infinitely many such primes remains plausible. They would form yet another infinite family of "binary-centric" primes, akin to Mersenne primes (which are primes with a full-period binary reciprocal of period $p-1$) but with a different structural origin. It would be interesting to further investigate the sequence for larger $n$ – perhaps using a distributed search that applies our filtering criteria to reach, say, $n=200$ or $n=500$. Each prime discovered would set a new record for reciprocals with large base-2 repetend length relative to $\varphi(p)$.

Another direction for future work is to seek a deeper theoretical understanding of the avoidance of pseudoprimality in this sequence. Is it true that no composite $s_n$ can be a base- $2$ strong pseudoprime? If so, one might be able to prove that a single base (say $a=2$ or $a=3$) suffices to test $s_n$ for primality, which would be a remarkable property. Additionally, examining analogues of $s_n$ for other bases (replacing 2 by 3 in the formula, for instance) could yield similar sequences where the chosen base has a specified order modulo the terms.

In conclusion, the sequence $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ provides a rich case study at the intersection of number theory and computational prime searching. It highlights how a number's binary expansion and modular structure can strongly constrain its divisors and multiplicative order. While full-period reciprocals (base 2\) occur only in the trivial initial case for this sequence, the primes that do appear still possess long periods and are of interest in both theory and applications. Further exploration, both computational and theoretical, may shed more light on the distribution of these primes and the underlying reason why $2$ is a primitive root mod $s_n$ only in exceptional circumstances. The continuing search for primes in this sequence thus represents an intriguing blend of deep theory (primitive roots, orders, arithmetic progressions) and practical algorithm design (sieves and primality tests), exemplifying the "deep research" spirit of computational number theory.
