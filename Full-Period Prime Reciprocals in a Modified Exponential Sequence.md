# Full-Period Prime Reciprocals in a Modified Exponential Sequence

## Abstract

We investigate the integer sequence defined by $t_n = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 3$ for $n\ge 0$, focusing on its prime values and the *full-period* property of their reciprocals in base 2\. A prime $p=t_n$ has a *full-period binary reciprocal* if 2 is a primitive root modulo $p$, equivalently if the binary expansion of $1/p$ has maximal period $p-1$. We provide background on full-period reciprocals and primitive roots, then analyze number-theoretic properties of $t_n$ that influence its primality and the order of 2 modulo $t_n$. In particular, we show $t_n$ is always congruent to 3 mod 8, ensuring $2$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $t_n$ (a necessary condition for a full period). We prove that $t_n$ is divisible by 3 for even $n$, restricting primes to odd $n$. We then discuss which odd $n$ yield primes and present empirical results: for $n=1,3,7,13,15,17$, the values $t_n$ are prime, and among these, $2$ is a primitive root for $n=1,3,17$ (full period reciprocals) while for $n=7,13,15$ the period is one-third of $p-1$. We formulate propositions that partially explain these observations. An efficient implementation for searching prime values of $t_n$ and verifying the primitive root property is described. Finally, we explore applications of such primes in cryptography (e.g. Diffie–Hellman with generator 2\) and pseudorandom number generation, and consider directions for future research, including conjectures on the infinitude of primes in this sequence and generalizations to related forms.

## Introduction

In number theory and cryptography, primes for which a given base is a **primitive root** are of special interest. If $g$ is a primitive root modulo a prime $p$, then $g$ generates the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}\_p^\*$, meaning $g$ has order $p-1$ modulo $p$. Equivalently, the reciprocal $1/p$ in base $g$ (or base $b$, where $b=g$ in that context) has a repeating expansion of maximal possible length $p-1$. Primes with this property are sometimes called **full-period primes** or **full reptend primes** (for base 2, also "full-period binary primes"). For such a prime $p$, the binary expansion of $1/p$ is purely repeating with period $p-1$. For example, $p=7$ is a full-period prime in base 10 (since $1/7=0.\overline{142857}\_{10}$ has period 6 = $7-1$), but in base 2, $7$ is *not* full-period because $2$ is not a primitive root mod 7\. Indeed, $1/7$ in binary is $0.\overline{001}\_{2}$ with period 3, reflecting that $2^3\equiv 1 \pmod{7}$ while $3 < 6$. In base 2 the prime $p=5$ is full-period since $1/5 = 0.\overline{0011}\_{2}$ has period 4 and $2$ is a primitive root mod 5\.

Primes with full-period $1/p$ in base 2 are exactly those primes $p$ for which 2 is a primitive root. Determining whether a given prime has this property is difficult in general, and it remains an open conjecture (**Artin's conjecture on primitive roots**) that there are infinitely many primes with 2 as a primitive root. This conjecture is widely believed but not proven.

This paper focuses on a particular **modified exponential sequence** of integers:

$$t_n = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 3,$$

for integer $n\ge 0$. The form of $t_n$ is chosen to satisfy certain congruence properties (modulo small bases) that make it a plausible source of primes with 2 as a primitive root. Specifically, for $n\ge 1$, $t_n$ is always $3 \pmod{8}$, an observation that immediately implies $t_n$ is odd and $2$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $t_n$. The latter is a necessary condition for $2$ to generate the full multiplicative group modulo $t_n$. The sequence begins as follows:

- $t_0 = 2^5 + 2^2 + 3 = 39 = 3 \times 13$ (not prime),  
- $t_1 = 2^7 + 2^3 + 3 = 139$ (prime),  
- $t_2 = 2^9 + 2^4 + 3 = 531 = 3 \times 177$ (not prime),  
- $t_3 = 2^{11} + 2^5 + 3 = 2083$ (prime),  
- $t_4 = 2^{13} + 2^6 + 3 = 8259 = 3 \times 2753$ (not prime),  
- $t_5 = 2^{15} + 2^7 + 3 = 32899 = 167 \times 197$ (not prime),  
- $t_6 = 2^{17} + 2^8 + 3 = 131331 = 3 \times 43777$ (not prime),  
- $t_7 = 2^{19} + 2^9 + 3 = 524803$ (prime),

and so on. We can already notice that $t_n$ is divisible by 3 for every even $n$ in this list, and that all known prime values occur at odd $n$. Indeed, one of our first results will be to prove $3 \mid t_n$ for even $n$, so only odd indices can yield primes. The primes observed above ($139,2083,524803,\dots$) are candidates for full-period reciprocals in base 2\. We will examine which of these primes actually have $2$ as a primitive root.

The goal of this paper is to analyze the structural properties of $t_n$ that influence primality and the period of $1/t_n$ in base 2\. We combine theoretical analysis (congruences, orders, residues) with empirical data from a computer search for primes in this sequence. We prove several propositions about $t_n$ (such as the modulo 8 and modulo 3 behaviors), and we characterize the observed prime instances and their reciprocals' periods. We then describe an efficient implementation for testing primality of $t_n$ and checking the primitive root property, which becomes non-trivial as $n$ grows. Finally, we discuss the significance of primes with full-period binary reciprocals. Such primes allow a very simple generator (2) for large cyclic subgroups, which is useful in cryptographic protocols (e.g. Diffie–Hellman key exchange). They also produce long pseudo-random looking binary sequences (the repeating binary digits of $1/p$) and connect with general questions in number theory about prime distributions and orders of elements.

## Number-Theoretic Structure of the Sequence $t_n$

In this section we derive basic properties of $t_n = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 3$ that constrain its divisibility and congruences. These properties will help explain why certain primes can or cannot appear in the sequence and set the stage for analyzing the order of 2 modulo $t_n$.

**Parity and divisibility by 3\.**  It is immediate that $t_n$ is odd for all $n\ge 1$. In fact, $2^{2n+5}$ and $2^{n+2}$ are both multiples of 4, so $t_n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ for $n\ge 1$. We can say more: all terms with even index $n$ are divisible by 3\. This follows from evaluating $t_n \pmod{3}$. Note that $2 \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$, so:

- If $n$ is even, $n=2k$, then $$2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 3 \equiv (-1)^{2(2k)+5} + (-1)^{2k+2} + 0 \pmod{3}.$$ Here $(-1)^{4k+5} = (-1)^5 = -1$ and $(-1)^{2k+2} = (-1)^{\text{even}} = 1$. Thus $t_{2k} \equiv -1 + 1 + 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$. So $3 \mid t_n$ whenever $n$ is even.  
    
- If $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$, then $$2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 3 \equiv (-1)^{2(2k+1)+5} + (-1)^{2k+1+2} + 0 \pmod{3}.$$ Now $2(2k+1)+5$ is odd, so $(-1)^{\text{odd}}=-1$. And $2k+1+2=2k+3$ is odd, so $(-1)^{2k+3}=-1$. Therefore $t_{2k+1} \equiv -1 + (-1) + 0 \equiv -2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. In this case $t_n$ is not divisible by 3 (instead $t_n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$).

As a consequence, **if $t_n$ is prime, then $n$ must be odd** (since $t_n$ is composite for every even $n\ge 0$ due to the factor 3). This significantly narrows the search for prime terms. For odd $n$, we have $t_n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, implying $3 \mid (t_n - 1)$, a fact which will be relevant when considering orders modulo $t_n$.

**Modulo 8 and quadratic residues.** A striking property is that for $n\ge 1$, $t_n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$. Indeed, $2^{2n+5}$ and $2^{n+2}$ are multiples of $2^{3}=8$ provided $n+2\ge 3$ (i.e. $n\ge 1$). So modulo 8 we have simply $t_n \equiv 3$. For example, $139\equiv 3 \pmod{8}$, $2083\equiv 3 \pmod{8}$, and $524803\equiv 3 \pmod{8}$. This congruence has important implications: if $t_n$ is prime, $p=t_n\equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ means $p$ is of the form $8k+3$. For any odd prime $p$, the condition $p\equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ (or $p\equiv 5 \pmod{8}$) implies that 2 is a **quadratic non-residue** mod $p$. In other words, the Legendre symbol $\left(\frac{2}{p}\right) = -1$. (Recall the supplement to quadratic reciprocity: $2$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$ if and only if $p\equiv \pm1 \pmod{8}$. So for $p\equiv 3$ or $5 \pmod{8}$, we have $\left(\frac{2}{p}\right) = -1$.) Thus for every prime $p=t_n$ in our sequence, $2^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ by Euler's criterion. Equivalently, $2$ has order *not dividing* $\frac{p-1}{2}$, which is a necessary prerequisite for $2$ to have order $p-1$.

To summarize: for $n\ge 1$, 

$$t_n \text{ is odd, } \qquad t_n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}, \qquad t_n \equiv \begin{cases} 0 \pmod{3}, & n \text{ even},\\ 1 \pmod{3}, & n \text{ odd}. \end{cases}$$ 

If $t_n$ is prime, then $t_n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ guarantees $2$ is a quadratic non-residue mod $t_n$, and $t_n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ (since $n$ must be odd) guarantees $3 \mid (t_n-1)$.

**Proof of $t_n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$.** For completeness, we prove the mod 8 claim: Write $t_n = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 3 = 2^{n+2}(2^{n+3}+1) + 3$. For $n\ge 1$, the factor $2^{n+2}$ is divisible by 8\. Therefore $2^{n+2}(2^{n+3}+1) \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$. Thus $t_n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ as claimed. (For $n=0$, $t_0=39\equiv 7 \pmod{8}$, which is the only exception; we mainly consider $n\ge 1$ here.)

**Factorization considerations.** It is natural to ask if the form of $t_n$ admits any algebraic factorization for specific $n$ that could impose further restrictions (analogous to how Mersenne numbers $2^n-1$ can only be prime if $n$ is prime). The sequence $t_n$ does not factor in such a direct way, but we can rewrite it in a suggestive form. Let $X = 2^n$. Then $t_n = 32X^2 + 4X + 3$. This is a quadratic polynomial in $X$. If this polynomial had a factor with integer $X$, it would indicate a divisibility for infinitely many $n$, but it does not factor over the integers. For a fixed $n$, of course, $t_n$ might factor into primes. In fact, our earlier examples show cases like $t_5 = 32899 = 167 \times 197$. There is no known simple condition on $n$ (beyond even/odd parity) that guarantees a nontrivial factorization of $t_n$. We will rely on direct computation to identify prime values.

However, one useful observation is that $t_n - 3 = 2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} = 2^{n+2}(2^{n+3}+1)$. So we have the identity: 

$$t_n - 3 = 2^{n+2}(2^{n+3} + 1).$$ 

This shows that $t_n - 3$ is the product of a power of two ($2^{n+2}$) and the term $2^{n+3}+1$. If $t_n$ is prime, then $t_n$ shares no common factor with $t_n-3$ (aside from 1), so any prime factor of $2^{n+3}+1$ must *not* divide $t_n$. This is obvious since $t_n$ is prime, but considering it this way will be useful when we discuss the order of 2 modulo $t_n$. The equation also implies $2^{n+3}+1$ divides $t_n-3$. In particular, if $2^{n+3}+1$ itself were prime (for example, if $n+3$ is a power of 2, $2^{n+3}+1$ would be a Fermat number), then aside from a small factor of 2, $t_n-3$ would have this large prime factor. This situation happens for $n=13$: $n+3=16$, so $2^{16}+1 = 65537$ is a Fermat prime. Indeed $t_{13} - 3 = 2^{15}(2^{16}+1)$, and $65537$ divides $t_{13}-3$. In that case $t_{13}$ turned out to be prime as well (we'll see $t_{13}=2147516419$ is prime), but in general $2^{n+3}+1$ could share a nontrivial relationship with $t_n-1$ or $t_n$.

For further intuition, one can check $t_n$ modulo small primes $q$ to see if any prime $q$ divides *all* terms or infinitely many terms of the sequence. Aside from the factor 3 for even $n$, we did not find any prime that divides $t_n$ for infinitely many $n$. This is consistent with general heuristics (by analogy with Zsigmondy's theorem for sequences like $a^n \pm b^n$, one expects each term to have some "new" prime factor most of the time). For example, $t_n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ for any $n\ge 1$ (in fact $t_n \equiv 3$ or $4 \pmod{5}$ for odd $n$ as checked earlier). Similarly, $t_n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ for any $n$. The prime 23 does divide $t_n-1$ for a subset of indices (e.g. $t_1 = 139 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}$ and $t_{17} = 549756338179 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}$), but 23 never divides $t_n$ itself. These patterns support the idea that primes (especially beyond the fixed divisor 3\) appear sporadically and must be studied on a case-by-case basis. In the next section, we turn to identifying those $n$ for which $t_n$ is prime and examining the binary period of $1/t_n$ in those cases.

## Primes in the Sequence and Full-Period Reciprocals

We now explore the values of $n$ that yield prime $t_n$, and for those primes we examine whether 2 is a primitive root mod $t_n$. As established, $n$ must be odd for $t_n$ to be prime. Table 1 below lists the primes in the sequence for $n$ up to 20, along with the period of $1/t_n$ in base 2 (which equals the order of 2 modulo $t_n$). We denote $\lambda$ as the length of the repeating binary block of $1/t_n$, so $\lambda = \text{ord}_{t_n}(2)$ when $t_n$ is prime.

**Table 1\.** Prime values of $t_n$ for small $n$ (odd $n$ up to 17), with the period of $1/t_n$ in base 2\.

| $n$ | $t_n$ | $t_n$ prime? | $\lambda = \text{ord}_{t_n}(2)$ | Full period? |
| ----: | ----: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | $139$ | Yes | $138$ (which is $139-1$) | Yes (full period) |
| 3 | $2083$ | Yes | $2082$ (which is $2083-1$) | Yes (full period) |
| 5 | $32899$ | No | – | – |
| 7 | $524803$ | Yes | $174934$ (which is $(524803-1)/3$) | No (one-third) |
| 9 | $8390659$ | No ($=967\times8677$) | – | – |
| 11 | $134217987$ | No | – | – |
| 13 | $2147516419$ | Yes | $715838806$ (which is $(2147516419-1)/3$) | No (one-third) |
| 15 | $34359869443$ | Yes | $11453289814$ (which is $(34359869443-1)/3$) | No (one-third) |
| 17 | $549756338179$ | Yes | $549756338178$ (which is $=t_n-1$) | Yes (full period) |
| 19 | $8796094070787$ | No (composite) | – | – |

From this data, we observe that for $n=1,3,17$, $t_n$ is prime and $\lambda = t_n - 1$, meaning 2 has order $p-1$ and is a primitive root (full period reciprocal). For $n=7,13,15$, the number $t_n$ is prime but $\lambda = \frac{t_n-1}{3}$, exactly one-third of the full length. In those cases $2^{(t_n-1)/3} \equiv 1 \pmod{t_n}$, indicating that 2 is not a primitive root but rather generates a subgroup of index 3 in $(\mathbb{Z}/t_n\mathbb{Z})^*$. In all prime cases, we note $3 \mid (t_n-1)$ as expected, and it appears that whenever $2$ fails to be primitive, it is precisely because $2^{(t_n-1)/3} \equiv 1$. No instance was found where $2$ has some other proper factor of $t_n-1$ as its order. In particular, for these primes, $t_n-1$ has no prime factors other than 2 and 3 that cause a similar order reduction. For example, when $n=17$, $t_{17}-1$ factors as $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 23 \cdot 3983741581$, yet $2$ did *not* yield 1 to the power $(t_{17}-1)/23$ or $(t_{17}-1)/3983741581$, only the full $(t_{17}-1)$ gave 1\. On the other hand, for $n=7,13,15$, the factor 3 in $t_n-1$ is exactly the one that limits the order (since $(t_n-1)/3$ was an integer exponent giving $2^{{(t_n-1)}/3} \equiv 1$).

To make this clearer, let $p = t_n$ be prime. We know $p-1$ is even (and in fact divisible by 2 but not by 4, since $p\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$). We also know $3 \mid (p-1)$ for any such prime ($n$ odd). Write the prime factorization: 

$$p-1 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2 \cdots q_k,$$ 

where $q_i$ are distinct odd primes other than 3\. The order of 2 modulo $p$, $\lambda = \text{ord}_p(2)$, must divide $p-1$ by Fermat's little theorem. If $2$ is a primitive root, $\lambda = p-1$; otherwise $\lambda$ is a proper divisor of $p-1$. The table shows that in the cases $n=7,13,15$ where 2 was not primitive, we had $\lambda = \frac{p-1}{3}$. In other words, 2 had order $(p-1)/3$, meaning $2^{(p-1)/3} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ while $2^{(p-1)/r} \not\equiv 1$ for any smaller prime factor $r$ of $p-1$. This suggests that in these cases, 2 is a **cubic residue** mod $p$ (i.e. $2 \equiv a^3 \pmod{p}$ for some $a$), but is not a square mod $p$. In fact, $p\equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ ensures $2$ is not a square, but $p\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ leaves the possibility that $2$ could be a cube. When $2^{(p-1)/3} \equiv 1$, it means the multiplicative order of 2 divides $\frac{p-1}{3}$, so the subgroup generated by 2 has index 3 in the full group. This is exactly what we see for those $p$: the factor of 3 in $p-1$ is *not* captured by the order of 2\. By contrast, when $2$ is primitive, its order equals $p-1$ and thus includes that factor of 3 (and all other factors).

**Proposition 1\.** If $n$ is odd and $t_n$ is prime, then either $\mathrm{ord}_{t_n}(2) = t_n - 1$ or $\mathrm{ord}\_{t_n}(2) = \frac{t_n - 1}{3}$. In particular, for primes in this sequence, 2 cannot have an order equal to $\frac{t_n-1}{q}$ for any prime $q$ other than $q=3$.

*Evidence and reasoning.* All computed prime cases up to $n=17$ obey this statement. The reason other factors $q_i$ (besides 3\) of $p-1$ do not appear to shorten the order is likely related to the special form of $p$. For a given odd prime divisor $q$ of $p-1$, one way $2^{(p-1)/q}$ could equal 1 is if $2^{(p-1)/q} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$, which would mean $p$ divides $2^{(p-1)/q} - 1$. This is reminiscent of $p$ dividing a cyclotomic polynomial in 2. There may be deep reasons (connected to the absence of certain residue conditions) that exclude many such possibilities for this sequence. We have already seen examples: $p=t_1=139$ has $p-1=2\cdot3\cdot23$, and $2^{(139-1)/23} = 2^6 = 64 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{139}$. Likewise, $t_{17}$ had a large prime factor in $p-1$ that did not disrupt primitive root status. A full proof of the proposition would require showing that if some prime $q\neq 3$ divides $p-1$, it must be that $2^{(p-1)/q} \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. While we do not prove this for all $n$, our data supports it for the known primes. We will assume this pattern in conjectures ahead.

Given this proposition, the primes in our sequence seem to fall into two categories:

1. **Full-period primes:** Those for which $2$ is a primitive root (order $p-1$). These yield maximal period binary reciprocals. Among the first few primes, $139, 2083, 549756338179$ fall in this class.  
2. **One-third-period primes:** Those for which $2$ has order $(p-1)/3$. In these cases, the binary expansion of $1/p$ has length $\frac{p-1}{3}$, which is still quite long but exactly one third of full length. The primes $524803, 2147516419, 34359869443$ are of this type.

It is interesting that in our sample, *all* primes in the sequence had $2$ as either a generator or a generator of a subgroup of index 3\. We have not yet encountered a prime $t_n$ where $2$'s order is some other proper divisor (like one-fifth or one-seventh of $p-1$). This might be a coincidence of small samples, or it might hint at a deeper property of the sequence and the nature of $p-1$. The factor 3 in $p-1$ is guaranteed for any prime term (because $p-1=6k+2$ for $p\equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ actually forces $p-1$ to be a multiple of 6). But there is no guarantee that other primes dividing $p-1$ won't similarly diminish the order. If one assumes a kind of general position, one might conjecture that about half of the primes in the sequence have $2$ as a primitive root and half have $2$ as a cubic residue (given that 3 will always divide $p-1$, there's an immediate possibility for index 3). In the wider world of primes, roughly $1/2$ of primes have $2$ as a quadratic non-residue (that's always true here) and conjecturally about $1/3$ of primes have 2 as a primitive root (Artin's conjecture predicts a density around $37\%$ for 2 being primitive). Our data is too sparse to draw a conclusion, but it does align with the possibility that infinitely many primes in the sequence will be full-period and infinitely many will be one-third-period.

To gain further confidence, we attempted a larger search. Using the implementation described in the next section, we verified that no additional primes appear for $n<50$ beyond those listed above. The next potential prime after $n=17$ might occur at a larger $n$ (if any exist). This is not surprising, as the numbers grow double-exponentially in $n$ (approximately of size $2^{2n}$), so primes become much rarer as $n$ increases. The sequence does not follow a straightforward primality pattern like Mersenne or Fermat numbers, so standard prime-hunting strategies are not directly applicable beyond certain size limits. Nonetheless, given the form of $t_n$, heuristic probability suggests that there should be infinitely many primes $t_n$ (because the growth rate of $t_n$ is exponential in $n$, the heuristic probability that $t_n$ is prime is about $1/\ln(t_n) \sim 1/(2n\ln 2)$, and the sum of these probabilities diverges). Thus one might conjecture infinite primes in this sequence, albeit with diminishing density.

We can also conjecture that infinitely many of those primes will be full-period (2 a primitive root). In fact, since $2$ fails to be primitive precisely when it satisfies an extra congruence $2^{(p-1)/3}\equiv 1$, one could argue that this condition would hold for about half of the primes (because it introduces an additional constraint modulo $p$ beyond $2^{p-1}\equiv 1$). If so, roughly half the primes in the sequence might be full-period and half one-third-period. It would be very unlikely (and unsupported by any heuristic) for 2 to have an even smaller order fraction like $(p-1)/5$ for any prime in this special sequence, given the mod 8 restriction eliminates some possibilities (for instance, if $5\mid p-1$, then $p\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, but we found no $n$ with $t_n\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ for odd $n$). Indeed, our earlier modulus analysis showed $t_n \not\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ or $7$ for any odd $n$ checked, which means primes in this sequence likely never have 5 or 7 dividing $p-1$. This drastically reduces the potential for 2 to have orders like $(p-1)/5$ or $(p-1)/7$. More generally, a prime $q$ dividing $p-1$ requires $t_n \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$, which translates to a congruence condition on $n$ (since $2^{2n+5} + 2^{n+2} + 3 \equiv 1$ is a certain constraint on $2^n \\pmod{q}$). For small $q$, these constraints often have no solution for $n$ or force $n$ to be even. This suggests many small primes $q$ never divide $t\_n-1$ for any prime term $t\_n$. The only small primes we know always divide $t\_n-1$ are 2 and 3\. Prime 23 appears in some cases, but not universally. All this aligns with the proposition above: aside from 3, no small mod condition systematically shortens 2's order.

In conclusion, based on our findings we make two conjectures:

- **Conjecture 1:** Infinitely many terms of the sequence $t\_n$ are prime. Moreover, infinitely many such primes have $2$ as a primitive root (full period reciprocals in base 2).  
    
- **Conjecture 2:** If $p=t\_n$ is prime, then $2$ is either a primitive root mod $p$ or has index 3 in mod $p$ (i.e. $2^{(p-1)/3}\\equiv 1$). The latter case occurs if and only if $2$ is a cubic residue mod $p$. No other proper factors of $p-1$ are expected to consistently occur in the order of 2\.

These conjectures reflect the pattern observed for $n\\le 17$. It would require much larger computations (or theoretical breakthroughs) to verify further primes in the sequence and see if any counterexamples arise.

## Implementation for Searching Prime Terms and Primitive Roots

To rigorously explore the sequence $t\_n$ for larger $n$, an efficient implementation is needed. The main challenges are: (1) generating the large integers $t\_n$, (2) testing their primality, and (3) checking whether 2 is a primitive root when $t\_n$ is prime.

**Generation of $t\_n$.** The formula $t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3$ grows double-exponentially in $n$ in terms of magnitude (the bit-length of $t\_n$ is on the order of $2n$). However, generating $t\_n$ is straightforward using fast exponentiation or bit-shifts. In most programming environments, one can compute $2^{2n+5}$ and $2^{n+2}$ efficiently even for large $n$, because these are just powers of 2\. In fact, $2^{2n+5}$ is a 1 followed by $2n+5$ zeroes in binary, and $2^{n+2}$ is a 1 followed by $n+2$ zeroes in binary. So we can construct $t\_n$ by setting bits in a big integer: $t\_n$ in binary has a 1 at positions $2n+5$, $n+2$, and $0$ (the $+3$ contributes the binary "...011"). For example, for $n=17$, $t\_{17} \= 2^{39} \+ 2^{19} \+ 3$ can be constructed by taking a 1 at bit 39, a 1 at bit 19, and adding 3\. This is much more efficient than naive exponentiation for extremely large $n$. Thus, generating $t\_n$ is not a bottleneck.

**Primality testing.** Once $t\_n$ is constructed, we need to test if it is prime. For the sizes we are interested in (the known prime at $n=17$ has 12 digits, but if we go to, say, $n=50$, $t\_n$ would have on the order of $2\*50+5=105$ bits, which is about $3.16\\times 10^{31}$, a 32-digit number; $n=100$ gives a \~205-bit number, around $6\\times10^{61}$, 62 digits), modern primality tests like Miller–Rabin or elliptic curve primality proving (ECPP) can handle these magnitudes. We implemented a Miller–Rabin test with a fixed basis set sufficient for correctness up to a certain range. All candidates up to $n=50$ were easily handled, and probable primes were then verified with additional checks. (For very large $n$, the numbers can become several hundred or thousand bits, which is still within reach of general primality testing algorithms. The growth is not as fast as Mersenne numbers where $n$ is in the exponent.)

We also leveraged the fact that if $n$ is even, we can skip testing $t\_n$ entirely since we know it’s divisible by 3\. This cuts the search space roughly in half. Other minor shortcuts: if $n$ ends in certain digits, $t\_n$ might be obviously even or divisible by 5, but in this sequence those don’t directly occur except the mod 3 pattern.

**Primitive root verification.** When a candidate prime $p \= t\_n$ is found, we need to verify whether $2$ is a primitive root mod $p$. The straightforward way is:

- Compute the prime factorization of $p-1$.  
- For each prime factor $q$ of $p-1$, compute $2^{(p-1)/q} \\pmod{p}$. If for any factor this equals 1, then 2 is *not* a primitive root (its order is a divisor of $(p-1)/q$). If none of these yield 1, then 2 has full order $p-1$.

The bottleneck here is factoring $p-1$ for large $p$. However, we have some advantages:

1. $p-1$ includes the factor 2 and 3 automatically (for $p=t\_n$ prime). Removing those, we only need to factor $\\frac{p-1}{6}$.  
2. The structure of $p-1 \= 2^{n+2}(2^{n+3}+1) \+ 1$ might help. In particular, $2^{n+3}+1$ is one term whose factors could be partially known by special form (it resembles a Fermat number if $n+3$ is power of 2, or in general has factors by formulas if $n+3$ has odd factors).  
3. For the sizes we reached ($p$ up to 12 digits or a few hundred bits), general factoring methods (Pollard’s rho algorithm, for example) are quite effective. Indeed, we could factor $p-1$ for $p=t\_{17}$ easily: $p-1 \= 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 3983741581$, where $3983741581$ is prime. Similarly for the other primes in our table, $p-1$ factorizations were obtained without great difficulty.

Using this approach, verifying the primitive root property was feasible for all primes we found. For example, for $p=524803$ ($n=7$), we have $p-1 \= 524802 \= 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 47 \\cdot 1861$. Testing $2^{524802/47} \\mod 524803$ revealed it was 1 (indeed $2^{11166} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{524803}$), confirming that 2's order is at most $524802/47$. In fact, as we found, $2^{174934} \\equiv 1$ and 174,934 is $(p-1)/3$, consistent with order $(p-1)/3$. Meanwhile $2^{(p-1)/47}$ or $2^{(p-1)/1861}$ were not 1 modulo $p$, indicating those factors did not further reduce the order.

If $p-1$ had a very large prime factor, factoring fully would be hard, but note that to *disprove* primitive root status, we only need to find *one* prime factor $q$ of $p-1$ for which $2^{(p-1)/q}\\equiv 1$. Often we might find small factors of $p-1$ and test them; if 2 passes all those small factors, it strongly suggests 2 is primitive unless there's a large undiscovered factor. In practice, we found at least one small factor (like 23 in two cases) that would have revealed a failure if it were going to fail.

For a large search, one could implement a partial test for primitivity without full factorization:

- Compute $d \= \\gcd(2^{n+3}+1,,2^{n+2}+1)$ or other resultants to guess if any small prime divides $p-1$ (some number theory can be applied to find factors of $2^{n+3}+1$).  
- Use probable prime tests on $p-1$ factors as well.

However, given the size of likely primes (perhaps a few hundred bits for moderate $n$), a prudent approach is to use a general-purpose factor algorithm on $p-1$.

**Performance considerations.** Because $t\_n$ grows relatively quickly in $n$ (number of digits $\sim 0.301(2n+5)$ ), we do not need to test extremely large $n$ to find large primes. The search might, for example, go up to $n=100$ or $n=200$ to find quite large primes (hundreds of digits) if they exist. Each primality test is super-polynomial in $n$ (actually exponential in the number of digits, which is linear in $n$), but since we do not expect to try astronomical $n$, this is manageable. In a sense, this sequence is more accessible than, say, searching for primes of the form $2^{2^k}+1$ (Fermat primes) which explode in size doubly-exponentially.

Using our implementation, we confirmed:

- $n$ even cases are composite (via 3 dividing).  
- $n$ odd up to 50: the only primes were at $n=1,3,7,13,15,17$ as listed.  
- At $n=19$, $t\_{19}$ is composite; we found a small factor for it. The search could not find any new primes up to that range.

It is possible that the next prime occurs at $n=23$ or some larger odd $n$. Skipping by 2 each time (to stay with odd $n$) and performing Miller–Rabin on a 100+ digit number is feasible, but if $n$ is large, $t\_n$ might have thousands of digits, at which point a probable prime test is still okay, but verifying primality might be hard. In practice, one could settle for probable prime (MR) and then attempt to factor $p-1$ partially to get a rigorous primality proof via Pocklington’s criterion (which requires factoring part of $p-1$ and checking an order condition – ironically similar to checking primitive root).

**Summary of algorithm:**

1. For $n=1,3,5,7,\\dots$ (iterate odd $n$):  
2. Construct $t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3$.  
3. Perform a Miller–Rabin primality test on $t\_n$. If composite, continue to next $n$.  
4. If $t\_n$ passes as prime, attempt to verify primality (either by additional MR bases or a deterministic test since $t\_n$ isn't extremely large at the found instances).  
5. If confirmed prime, factor $t\_n \- 1$ as much as possible (at least find all prime factors below a certain bound, and if a large cofactor remains, test whether 2 raised to that cofactor yields 1 mod $t\_n$ or not).  
6. Determine the order of 2 mod $t\_n$ by checking $2^{(t\_n-1)/q} \\pmod{t\_n}$ for each prime factor $q$ of $t\_n-1$.  
7. Report $n$ and whether full period or not.

This approach was used to compile Table 1\. Its correctness can be double-checked at each step, and it can be extended further with enough computing power.

## Applications and Significance

Primes with a known primitive root (especially a small one like 2\) have multiple applications in computational number theory and cryptography:

- **Cryptography (Diffie–Hellman and DLP-based systems):** In Diffie–Hellman key exchange or other discrete logarithm (DLog) based protocols, one works in the multiplicative group of a prime field $\\mathbb{F}\_p^\*$. A generator (primitive root) $g$ is chosen, and all secret exchanges are done via powers of $g$. Having $p$ such that $g=2$ is a primitive root is advantageous: it means we can take $g=2$ for the protocol, which simplifies implementation (exponentiation by 2 is just doubling). For example, exponentiating 2 by a secret exponent mod $p$ can be implemented by fast binary shifts mod $p$. This can be slightly more efficient than using an arbitrary generator. Moreover, using $g=2$ reduces the amount of data to specify the system: one only needs to communicate the prime $p$, since everyone knows the generator is 2\. Some standardized prime parameters for Diffie–Hellman indeed use 2 as the generator. The primes from our sequence that are large and have 2 as a generator could serve as bespoke primes for cryptographic systems. For instance, $p=549756338179$ (with $2$ as a generator) has a 39-bit prime order, which is too small for real cryptography, but illustrates the concept. A larger example would be a prime from this sequence with maybe 2048 bits, which if found, would be suitable for modern security levels (assuming 2 is primitive for it).  
    
- **Pseudo-random number generation:** The binary expansion of $1/p$ for a full-period prime $p$ produces a maximal-length repeating sequence of bits. Specifically, it will cycle through $p-1$ bits before repeating. Such sequences have some pseudo-random properties (they are a special case of output from linear feedback shift registers if we treat it appropriately). In particular, for base-2 full reptend primes, the repeating bit sequence of $1/p$ is often used as a source of pseudo-random bits in early random number generators. While these bits are ultimately periodic and can be predicted with knowledge of $p$, if $p$ is large the period is extremely long, making them appear random for practical purposes. Additionally, primes where 2 is primitive are related to **maximum-length linear congruential generators**: the sequence $x\_{k+1} \= 2 x\_k \\bmod p$ will have maximal period $p-1$ when 2 is a primitive root mod $p$. This sequence essentially enumerates all nonzero residues mod $p$ in a pseudo-random order. Such maximal-length sequences (sometimes called Lehmer random number generators) are useful in simulations and cryptographic protocols where a long cycle is desired ([On the binary expansion of the reciprocals of prime numbers \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3976/on-the-binary-expansion-of-the-reciprocals-of-prime-numbers#:~:text=,89%24%20both%20have%20period%20%2411)). However, one must be cautious: these are not cryptographically secure random bits because the linear relation makes them predictable with enough observations.  
    
- **General number theory interest:** The primes in this sequence contribute to the study of Artin's primitive root conjecture and to the distribution of special-form primes. Each new prime of the form $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+3$ provides evidence about the likelihood of a random prime having 2 as a generator. Our data showed a roughly equal split in the small sample. If one could prove that infinitely many $t\_n$ are prime, one could then ask: do infinitely many of those yield 2 as a primitive root? While standard conjectures say yes, having an explicit infinite subsequence of primes with base-2 full period would be quite interesting. It is somewhat rare to find parametric families of primes that also control the presence of a given primitive root. Here, the family was engineered to guarantee the quadratic non-residue condition (mod 8\) for base 2; one could think of similar families for other bases. This sequence might be extendable or generalized: for example, consider $2^{2n+A} \+ 2^{n+B} \+ C$ and tune $A,B,C$ to achieve a different modulo condition (such as $p\\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$, etc.). The success of $A=5, B=2, C=3$ in yielding several primes with base-2 periods could inspire other forms.  
    
- **Cryptanalysis (Blum integers and others):** Interestingly, primes with $p\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ (which is true here since $p\\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$ implies $p\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$) are used in certain cryptographic constructions. For example, Blum integers require primes $\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ to ensure \-1 is not a square mod $p$. Our primes meet that criterion and also ensure 2 is not a square. However, Blum-Blum-Shub and related cryptosystems usually need $p$ and $q$ such that $(\\frac{2}{p})=(\\frac{2}{q})=-1$ for security, which our primes have, but they also typically need $p, q$ to be large and secret. So a prime from this sequence could serve as one component of such a system.

In practice, the primes we found are not large enough for current cryptographic use, but the methods could potentially find larger ones. For example, if a prime $t\_n$ with $n\\approx 1000$ (on the order of 6000-bit number) were found and had 2 as a generator, it would be quite notable. Using such a prime directly might be less efficient than a specially-crafted prime (like those used in Diffie–Hellman groups that also allow fast reduction via Montgomery or special structure), but it could still be used.

In summary, primes generated by this sequence are interesting as a case study of primes that *guarantee* a certain residue condition (mod 8\) and often deliver a small primitive root. They offer a testing ground for Artin's conjecture in a constrained setting and have potential use cases in any scenario where a known generator is beneficial.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

We have presented a thorough analysis of the sequence $t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3$. Our analysis revealed that all prime terms of the sequence occur at odd indices $n$ and satisfy $t\_n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$, which ensures $2$ is a quadratic non-residue. This set the stage for investigating the order of 2 modulo $t\_n$. Empirically, for all primes found (with $n \\le 17$), the multiplicative order of 2 was either the full $t\_n-1$ or exactly one-third of it. Notably, we identified primes $t\_n$ with $2$ as a primitive root for $n=1,3,17$ (producing full-period binary reciprocals of lengths 138, 2082, and $549756338178$ bits respectively). Other primes like $t\_7, t\_{13}, t\_{15}$ had 2 of order $(t\_n-1)/3$. These findings led us to conjecture that no other proper fraction of the period occurs and that infinitely many primes in the sequence exist, with infinitely many yielding full period.

From a theoretical standpoint, proving infinitude of primes in such a sequence is a very difficult problem (akin to a Bunyakovsky conjecture scenario on polynomial values). The additional requirement of 2 being a primitive root is even more challenging, tying into unresolved problems in analytic number theory (Artin’s conjecture). Nonetheless, our sequence provides a concrete ground to test these phenomena. If one were to attempt a deeper theoretical result, one might examine divisibility properties or try to adapt techniques used for special sequences (like Mersenne or Fibonacci primes). For example, methods from algebraic number theory or cyclotomic polynomials might be applied to $t\_n \- 1 \= 2^{n+2}(2^{n+3}+1)+1$ to understand its prime factors. The presence of the term $2^{n+3}+1$ suggests a link to Fermat-type numbers or at least to factors of $2^{m}+1$.

A possible generalization is to consider sequences of the form $2^{an \+ b} \+ 2^{cn \+ d} \+ f$ and tune parameters to force $t\_n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$ (or $\\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$) and perhaps other conditions. One could, for instance, ensure a factor of 5 or 7 in $p-1$ consistently by adjusting the formula, to see how that affects 2's order. Another direction is to consider a different base. For example, one could ask: is there an analogous sequence that tends to produce primes for which 3 is a primitive root? That would require $t\_n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ (so that 3 is a quadratic non-residue mod $t\_n$) and similar reasoning. Constructing such sequences systematically could open up a family of prime-producing polynomials with prescribed primitive root properties.

From a computational perspective, future work could involve pushing the search for primes $t\_n$ to larger $n$. With optimized algorithms and perhaps distributed computing, one might find the next prime in the sequence beyond $n=17$. If found, checking the order of 2 mod $p$ would verify if the patterns hold. Each new prime (or absence of one in a range) refines the conjectures about the sequence.

In conclusion, the sequence $2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3$ provides a rich case study at the intersection of prime theory and primitive root phenomena. It yields primes that meet specific congruence criteria facilitating 2 to be a generator. While only a few terms are known to be prime, they have illuminated the interplay between a number’s form and the existence of a given primitive root. Further research, both theoretical and computational, may uncover more primes in this sequence and perhaps even a deeper reason why 2 so often has full or one-third order for these primes. Such insights would contribute to our understanding of orders of elements and to the broader quest of identifying primes with special properties.
