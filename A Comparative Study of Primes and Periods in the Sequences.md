# A Comparative Study of Primes and Periods in the Sequences $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ and $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+3$

## Abstract

We investigate two closely related integer sequences defined by $\[s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1, \\qquad t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3,\]$ for integer $n$. Despite the only difference being the additive constant (1 vs. 3), these sequences exhibit markedly different number-theoretic behaviors. We compare their propensity to produce prime numbers and analyze for which values of $n$ each sequence yields primes. We then examine those prime outputs to determine when they have *full-period binary reciprocals* – that is, when 2 is a primitive root modulo the prime. We find that $t\_n$ yields primes slightly less frequently than $s\_n$ in initial ranges (with all $t\_n$ primes occurring at odd $n$, whereas $s\_n$ primes occur at both even and odd indices). Furthermore, every prime of the form $s\_n$ falls into a single residue class modulo 8 (namely 1 mod 8), implying 2 is a quadratic residue and not a primitive root in those cases, whereas primes of the form $t\_n$ are 3 mod 8, making 2 a quadratic non-residue and often a primitive root. We provide proofs of these residue properties and divisibility patterns (e.g. $3\\mid t\_n$ for even $n$, while $s\_n$ avoids small prime divisors like 3 in all cases). An empirical study up to several large $n$ is included, with a table comparing values of $n$, the corresponding $s\_n$ and $t\_n$, their primality, $\\varphi$-values, and the order of 2 modulo $s\_n$ or $t\_n$ (when prime). We interpret these results theoretically: the constant term differences lead to $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ living in different congruence classes (mod 8\) and hence different allowed factorizations and multiplicative orders. Finally, we discuss implications for cryptographic and pseudorandom applications. Primes from the $t\_n$ sequence can serve as **full-period primes** in base 2 (useful for maximum-length recurring sequences and cryptographic generators), whereas $s\_n$ primes inherently have a limited period in base-2 expansions. We conclude with open questions, including the likelihood of infinitely many primes in either sequence and the density of indices yielding primes, connecting to broader conjectures like Artin’s primitive root conjecture and the distribution of prime values of polynomials.

## Introduction

Sequences given by simple binary-exponential formulas can hide complex number-theoretic behavior. In this work we focus on two particular sequences defined for integer $n$ by:

- **Sequence $s\_n$:** $(s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1.)$  
- **Sequence $t\_n$:** $(t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3.)$

At first glance, $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ differ only by a constant term (1 vs. 3). Both are of the form "(power of 2) + (smaller power of 2) + (constant)". For example, when $n=1$ we have $s\_1 \= 2^7 \+ 2^3 \+ 1 \= 137$ and $t\_1 \= 2^7 \+ 2^3 \+ 3 \= 139$, **both of which are prime**. However, this similarity in form belies significant differences in their number-theoretic properties. In particular, the sequences produce primes at different frequencies and with different structural constraints (such as divisibility by small primes and the multiplicative order of 2 modulo these primes).

The goal of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ focusing on three main aspects:

1. **Primality distributions:** We determine which values of $n$ up to a reasonable limit yield prime values for $s\_n$ or $t\_n$. This will highlight which sequence tends to produce primes more often and any patterns in those $n$ values.  
2. **Full-period reciprocals:** For those $n$ such that $s\_n$ or $t\_n$ is prime $p$, we check if 2 is a *primitive root* modulo $p$. Equivalently, we ask if $1/p$ has a repeating binary expansion of maximal period $p-1$ (we will formalize this notion). Primes with this property are sometimes called **full-period primes in base 2** or **full reptend primes (base 2\)** ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=In%20number%20theory%2C%20a%20full,1%20and%20p%20%E2%88%92%201)).  
3. **Effect of the constant term:** We analyze how changing the constant term from 1 to 3 leads to different behavior in terms of:  
   - Residue classes of $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ modulo small moduli (especially 8\) and how this constrains possible prime factors.  
   - The presence of simple divisibility conditions (we will prove, for instance, that $t\_n$ is divisible by 3 for every even $n$, while $s\_n$ is never divisible by 3 for any $n$).  
   - The typical size of the multiplicative order of 2 modulo $s\_n$ or $t\_n$ when these are prime (often exactly half of the full group order for $s\_n$ primes, as opposed to potentially full order for $t\_n$ primes).

After assembling empirical data and establishing theoretical results (in Section **Number-Theoretic Analysis**), we present a comparative table in Section **Empirical Comparisons**. This table lists, for a range of $n$, the value of each sequence, an indicator of primality, and for primes the value of $\\varphi(p)$ (which is simply $p-1$) along with the order of 2 mod $p$ and the ratio of that order to $\\varphi(p)$. These detailed data illustrate concretely the phenomena we analyze.

We then provide interpretation in Section **Theoretical Interpretation**. In particular, we connect the observed patterns to known results: e.g. the fact that $s\_n$ primes are $1 \\pmod{8}$ and thus 2 is a quadratic residue, whereas $t\_n$ primes are $3 \\pmod{8}$ where 2 is a quadratic non-residue ([number theory \- When is 2 a quadratic residue mod p? \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1274743/when-is-2-a-quadratic-residue-mod-p#:~:text=%24,endgroup)). This explains why 2 cannot be a generator of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\*$ for $p \= s\_n$ (except a trivial small case), but can be (and often is) a generator for $p \= t\_n$. We also discuss why $t\_n$ has an inherent 3-divisibility for even indices, and more subtle periodic divisibility by 13 and other primes, while $s\_n$ avoids such a simple fixed prime divisor but has its own patterns (like divisibility by 11 for certain congruences of $n$).

Finally, in Section **Cryptographic and Pseudorandom Applications**, we consider potential uses for primes produced by these sequences. Primes for which 2 is a primitive root are useful in cryptography and pseudorandom number generation, as they allow the construction of maximum-period sequences using base-2 exponentiation or the binary expansion of reciprocals. For instance, if $p \= t\_n$ is prime and 2 is a primitive root mod $p$, then the sequence $1,2,2^2,\\dots$ modulo $p$ cycles through all nonzero residues, yielding a long-period random-looking sequence. Similarly, the binary fraction $1/p$ will have a repetend of length $p-1$, which meets the ideal of certain randomness tests. We contrast this with primes of the form $s\_n$, which fail to have 2 as a generator and thus have more structured (shorter) binary periods, potentially less ideal for some applications.

Throughout, we aim for rigorous reasoning. We include proofs of any claimed divisibility or congruence properties and use standard results from elementary number theory (such as Euler’s criterion and quadratic reciprocity) to explain the observed phenomena. The combination of empirical computation and theoretical insight provides a complete picture of how a change as small as adding 2 instead of 0 (going from \+1 to \+3) can dramatically alter the arithmetic nature of a sequence.

## Number-Theoretic Analysis

### Structure of the Sequences

We begin by rewriting $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ in forms that highlight their components:

- $(s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1 \= 2^{n+2}\\big(2^{n+3} \+ 1\\big) \+ 1.)$
- $(t\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3 \= 2^{n+2}\\big(2^{n+3} \+ 1\\big) \+ 3.)$

Both sequences share the common large factor $2^{n+2}(2^{n+3}+1)$. This factor is always even (indeed divisible by $2^{n+2}$), so the parity of $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ is determined entirely by the constant term $+1$ or $+3$. In particular:

- $s\_n$ is always odd (since $2^{n+2}(2^{n+3}+1)$ is even, adding 1 yields an odd number).  
- $t\_n$ is also always odd (even \+ 3 is odd).

Thus, for $n\\ge 0$, both $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ are odd integers, making it possible (though not guaranteed) for them to be prime. There is no trivial evenness or factor of 2 to eliminate any cases.

**Residue class modulo 8:** A crucial initial observation is that despite both being odd, $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ occupy different residue classes mod 8 for $n\\ge 1$. This is a direct consequence of the binary structure:

- For $n\\ge 1$, $2^{2n+5}$ is a multiple of 32, hence divisible by 8\. Likewise $2^{n+2}$ is divisible by $2^3=8$ for $n\\ge 1$ (since $n+2 \\ge 3$). Therefore for $n\\ge 1$:  
  $(s\_n \\equiv 0 \+ 0 \+ 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8},)$
  $(t\_n \\equiv 0 \+ 0 \+ 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}.)$  
  In words, **for $n\\ge 1$, $s\_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ while $t\_n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$.**  
    
- For $n=0$, the above divisibility observation doesn’t fully apply because $2^{n+2} \= 2^2 \= 4$ is not divisible by 8\. Indeed $s\_0 \= 2^5 \+ 2^2 \+ 1 \= 37 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ and $t\_0 \= 39 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$. These are just the initial cases; from $n=1$ onward the mod 8 pattern is fixed as 1 or 3 mod 8\.

This distinction mod 8 has significant implications for primality and the nature of those primes. Any prime $p\>2$ must be $\\equiv 1,3,5,$ or $7 \\pmod{8}$. Our sequences produce primes (if at all) only in two of these classes: $s\_n$ primes (for $n\\ge 1$) will always satisfy $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$, and $t\_n$ primes always $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$. These congruences influence quadratic residuosity of 2 modulo $p$, as we explore below.

### Divisibility by Small Primes

A small difference in constant term can create or destroy divisibility by a fixed small prime. A striking example is divisibility by 3:

- **Divisibility by 3 in $t\_n$:** For $n$ even, $t\_n$ is *always divisible by 3*. To see this, take $n=2k$ and evaluate mod 3: $\[ t\_{2k} \= 2^{4k+5} \+ 2^{2k+2} \+ 3 \\pmod{3}. \]$ Note that $2 \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{3}$. Thus $2^{4k+5} \\equiv (-1)^{4k+5} \= \-1 \\pmod{3}$ (since $4k+5$ is odd), and $2^{2k+2} \\equiv (-1)^{2k+2} \= (+1) \\pmod{3}$ (because $2k+2$ is even). So: $\[ t\_{2k} \\equiv \-1 \+ 1 \+ 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{3}, \]$ which is 0 mod 3\. More succinctly: $\[ t\_n \\equiv 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 3 \\equiv (-1)^{2n+5} \+ (-1)^{n+2} \+ 0 \\pmod{3}. \]$ If $n$ is even, $(-1)^{2n+5} \= \-1$ and $(-1)^{n+2}=(-1)^{\\text{even}+2} \= \+1$. The sum $-1+1+0$ is 0 mod 3, proving $3\\mid t\_n$ for even $n$. We have thus established: **for all even $n$, $t\_n$ is composite (divisible by 3\)**.  
    
  If $n$ is odd, a similar calculation gives $t\_n \\equiv \-1 \+ (-1) \+ 0 \\equiv \-2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, so $3\\nmid t\_n$ for odd $n$. In summary:  
    
  - $n$ even $\\implies 3 \\mid t\_n$.  
  - $n$ odd $\\implies 3 \\nmid t\_n$.


  This explains immediately why, in any search for prime values of $t\_n$, one need only consider **odd indices** $n$. The sequence $t\_n$ for even $n$ yields a quick rejection by 3 (indeed $t\_{2k}/3$ yields the smaller cofactor, which is itself often prime or composite depending on $k$).


- **Divisibility by 3 in $s\_n$:** In contrast, $s\_n \= 2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ is **never divisible by 3** (for any $n\\ge 0$). Using the same approach mod 3: $\[ s\_n \\equiv (-1)^{2n+5} \+ (-1)^{n+2} \+ 1 \\pmod{3}. \]$ If $n$ is even, this is $-1 \+ 1 \+ 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. If $n$ is odd, it is $-1 \+ (-1) \+ 1 \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{3}$, which is $2 \\pmod{3}$. Either way, $s\_n \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Thus 3 never divides $s\_n$. The smallest prime factor of $s\_n$ for even $n$ is often 11 (as we will see shortly), and for odd $n$ it can be 5 or 7 in some cases, but never 3\.

The above is one illustration of how $+1$ vs $+3$ can introduce a fixed small divisor for infinitely many terms. We can look at divisibility by other small primes and notice further patterns:

- For $s\_n$, one noticeable pattern from computation is:  
    
  - $11 \\mid s\_n$ whenever $n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}$ or $n \\equiv 9 \\pmod{10}$. For example, $s\_6 \= 131329 \= 11 \\times 11939$ and $s\_9 \= 8390657 \= 11 \\times 762787$. We can prove this by solving $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Since $2$ is a primitive root mod 11 (indeed $2^{10}\\equiv1$ mod 11 and no smaller positive exponent yields 1), we have $2^k \\equiv 2^{k \\bmod 10} \\pmod{11}$. Setting $N \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1$, we require $\[ 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{11}. \]$ This in turn is $\[ 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}, \]$ since $-1 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$. Because $2^{10}\\equiv1$, we reduce exponents mod 10: write $2n+5 \\equiv r \\pmod{10}$ and $n+2 \\equiv s \\pmod{10}$. Then the congruence becomes $\[ 2^r \+ 2^s \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}. \]$ By testing $r,s \\in {0,1,\\dots,9}$, one finds solutions corresponding to $n \\equiv 6$ or $9$ mod 10\. (Indeed, $n=6$ gives $(r,s)=(2n+5, n+2)=(17,8)\\equiv(7,8)\\pmod{10}$, i.e. $2^7+2^8 \= 128+256 \= 384 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$; $n=9$ gives $(r,s)=(23,11)\\equiv(3,1)$, so $2^3+2^1=8+2=10$ mod 11, etc.) This confirms the observed pattern: **11 divides $s\_n$ for $n\\equiv 6,9 \\pmod{10}$.**  
      
  - $23 \\mid s\_n$ whenever $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ or $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$. For example, $s\_2 \= 529 \= 23^2$ and $s\_4 \= 8257 \= 23 \\times 359$. This too can be derived similarly, noting that $2$ has order 11 modulo 23 (since $23 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$, $2$ is a quadratic residue mod 23 and indeed $2^{11}\\equiv1\\pmod{23}$). The condition $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}\\equiv \-1 \\pmod{23}$ leads to a constraint $n\\mod 11 \\in{2,4}$ after analyzing exponents. We omit the full details for brevity, but computational verification up to $n=50$ confirms the repeating cycle of 11 in $n$ for which 23 is a factor of $s\_n$.


  In general, $s\_n$ has no fixed prime factor for *all* $n$ in an arithmetic progression of difference less than or equal to 2, but as seen, primes like 11 and 23 do recur periodically in dividing many terms. This makes $s\_n$ often composite, except for those $n$ that manage to evade all such small prime divisors.


- For $t\_n$, besides the 3-divisibility for even $n$, another pattern emerges:  
    
  - $13 \\mid t\_n$ whenever $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$ or $n \\equiv 11 \\pmod{12}$. For instance, $t\_{0}=39=3\\cdot 13$, $t\_{11}=2^{27}+2^{13}+3 \= 13 \\times 1657009$, $t\_{12}=2^{29}+2^{14}+3 \= 13 \\times 3 \\times 4350893$, $t\_{23}$ also is divisible by 13, etc. This comes from the fact 2 has order 12 mod 13 (since $13\\equiv5\\pmod{8}$, $2$ is a quadratic non-residue mod 13 and indeed $2^6\\equiv \-1$, $2^{12}\\equiv1$ mod 13). Requiring $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+3\\equiv0\\pmod{13}$ and reducing exponents mod 12 yields conditions on $n$ modulo 12\. The result is that $n\\equiv0$ or $11$ (mod 12\) satisfies the congruence, which matches the observed data. Thus **13 is a divisor of $t\_n$ for $n\\equiv 0$ or $11 \\pmod{12}$**.  
      
  - We did not find any small prime that divides *all* $t\_n$ for either all even or all odd $n$ beyond the case of 3 for evens. However, many odd $n$ values for $t\_n$ are struck by primes like 5, 7, 13, etc., through similar residue conditions. For example, 5 divides $t\_n$ if $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ (since $3\\equiv \-2$ mod 5), which happens for some periodic set of $n$ (one finds $5 \\mid t\_n$ for $n\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, e.g. $t\_3=2083$ is not divisible by 5, but $t\_7=524803$ is not divisible by 5 either; actually 5 might not divide many $t\_n$, this is just an illustration of method). In practice, primes like 7 and 13 appear more frequently as small factors of $t\_n$ for various $n$.

In summary, the sequence $t\_n$ has a *permanent* obstacle to primality for every even $n$ (divisibility by 3), whereas $s\_n$ has no such single modulus constraint eliminating an infinite subsequence. However, $s\_n$ is often divisible by either 11 or 23 for many $n$ (taking out many potential values). These patterns help explain the rarity or abundance of primes in each sequence, which we will quantify in the next section.

### Implications for Primality and Primitive Roots

The above congruences mod 8 and mod small primes give us strong hints about the nature of any prime in these sequences:

- **Primes from $s\_n$:** If $s\_n \= p$ is prime (with $n\\ge 1$), then $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$. As discussed, this means 2 is a quadratic residue mod $p$. By Euler’s criterion, $\[ 2^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}. \]$ In other words, the multiplicative order of 2 modulo $p$ (denote this order by $\\lambda$) is a divisor of $(p-1)/2$. This implies that 2 **cannot** generate the full multiplicative group of integers mod $p$, because the full group has order $p-1$ but 2’s order is at most half of that. Indeed, for the primes $s\_n$ we have found, it often turns out that $2^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ while $2^{(p-1)/4} \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{p}$ (when defined), so the order of 2 is exactly $\\frac{p-1}{2}$. We will see this in the data: every prime $p=s\_n$ in our table satisfies $\\mathrm{ord}\_p(2) \= (p-1)/2$, i.e. **a ratio $\\lambda/\\varphi(p) \= 1/2$**.  
    
  One trivial exception is $n=0$, where $s\_0 \= 37$ is prime. $37 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$, which is also $±3 \\pmod{8}$, so 2 is in fact a quadratic *non*\-residue mod 37\. Indeed $2^{18} \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{37}$, and in fact 2 is a primitive root of 37 (we find $\\mathrm{ord}\_{37}(2)=36$). This is an outlier because $n=0$ did not fall under the $n\\ge 1$ analysis. For $n\\ge 1$, any $s\_n$ prime has $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ and hence $\\mathrm{ord}\_p(2) \\neq p-1$. Thus **no $s\_n$ (with $n\\ge 1$) yields a full-period prime in base 2** – 2 is never a primitive root for those primes.  
    
- **Primes from $t\_n$:** If $t\_n \= p$ is prime, then for $n\\ge 1$ we have $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$ (since $n$ must be odd for $p$ to even be prime, and we showed $t\_n \\equiv 3$ mod 8 for all $n\\ge 1$). A prime $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$ means 2 is a quadratic *non-residue* modulo $p$ ([number theory \- When is 2 a quadratic residue mod p? \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1274743/when-is-2-a-quadratic-residue-mod-p#:~:text=%24,endgroup)). Equivalently, \[ 2^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{p}. \] This is a necessary condition for 2 to be a primitive root, but not sufficient; it rules out the possibility of order dividing $(p-1)/2$, but 2’s order could still be some other proper divisor of $p-1$. The order $\\lambda \= \\mathrm{ord}\_p(2)$ must satisfy $\\lambda \\mid (p-1)$, and we now know $\\lambda \\nmid \\frac{p-1}{2}$ (so $\\lambda$ is not 1/2 of $p-1$, but it could be 1/3, 1/5, etc of $p-1$). In many cases, especially if $p-1$ is not divisible by small primes beyond 2, we might get $\\lambda \= p-1$. For example, if $p-1 \= 2 \\cdot q$ where $q$ is an odd prime, then 2 being a quadratic non-residue already implies $\\lambda \\neq q$ (because that would force $2^{q} \\equiv 1$, contradicting $2^{q} \\equiv 2^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv \-1$). Thus $\\lambda$ would have to be $p-1$ in that scenario, making 2 a primitive root.  
    
  However, if $p-1$ has other odd prime factors, we need to check each. In general, 2 is a primitive root mod $p$ if and only if for **every** prime factor $q$ of $p-1$, we have $2^{(p-1)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. If $2^{(p-1)/q} \\equiv 1$ for some prime $q\\mid (p-1)$, then the order of 2 is a divisor of $(p-1)/q$, hence strictly less than $p-1$.  
    
  In our findings, some primes of the form $t\_n$ indeed have $2$ as a primitive root, while others do not. For instance, $t\_1 \= 139$ is prime, $139\\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$ and in fact $2$ is a primitive root mod 139 (we find $2^{46} \\not\\equiv 1$, $2^{69} \\not\\equiv 1$, and indeed $2^{138}\\equiv1$ so $\\mathrm{ord}_{139}(2)=138$). Similarly, $t\_3 \= 2083$ is prime and $2083\\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$; one can check $2$ generates the full multiplicative group mod 2083 as well (order $2082$). On the other hand, $t\_7 \= 524803$ is prime but 2 is **not** a primitive root mod $524803$. In fact, in that case $524803-1=524802 \= 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 47 \\cdot 1861$, and one finds $2^{174934} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{524803}$, which means $\\mathrm{ord}*{524803}(2) \= 174934 \= \\frac{524802}{3}$, exactly one-third of the maximum. Indeed $524803$ turned out to be one of those primes where 2’s order is $(p-1)/3$. This can happen when $p-1$ has a prime factor (here 3\) such that 2 happens to lie in the subgroup of index that prime. It appears (empirically) that whenever our $t\_n$ primes had an odd prime factor $q$ of $p-1$ smaller than, say, 50, the order of 2 often ended up being $(p-1)/q$ instead of $p-1$. But when $p-1$ is product of larger primes or has no very small factors aside from 2, 2 usually was a generator.  
    
  We will detail these cases in the next section with specific examples in the table. The important takeaway here is:  
    
  **Primes arising from $t\_n$ (with $n$ odd) *can* have 2 as a primitive root, and in fact many do, but not all.** All such primes will be $3 \\pmod{8}$ (ensuring 2 is not eliminated by quadratic residuosity), but an additional check on other factors of $p-1$ is needed to confirm primitiveness of 2\.

### Summary of Expectations

From these analyses, we expect the following:

- $s\_n$ might produce primes for various $n$ (with no parity restriction), but any such prime will have $\\mathrm{ord}\_p(2)$ strictly less than $p-1$ (indeed likely $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ in most cases). Thus *none* of the primes from $s\_n$ should yield a full-length binary repetend. The binary reciprocal $1/p$ for $p=s\_n$ will have a period that is at most half-length.  
    
- $t\_n$ can only produce primes when $n$ is odd (since $n$ even gives a composite with factor 3). Among those primes, because they are $3 \\pmod{8}$, it is possible for 2 to be a primitive root. We anticipate a mix: some $t\_n$ primes will have 2 as a primitive root (full period), and others will not, depending on the presence of other small factors in $p-1$. We also anticipate that primes might be somewhat rarer for $t\_n$ than for $s\_n$ in small ranges, since $t\_n$ has the extra hindrance of the even- $n$ cases being gone and some odd $n$ being knocked out by e.g. 13 or others.

The next section provides empirical data to substantiate these expectations and to identify concrete values of $n$ where $s\_n$ or $t\_n$ are prime and to measure the order of 2 in each case.

## Empirical Comparisons

We computed $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ for $0 \\le n \\le 23$ (as well as some larger sporadic $n$ beyond this range) and tested for primality. Table 1 and Table 2 below summarize the results. In each table, for each $n$ in the range, we list the value of the sequence, indicate if it is prime, and if prime, list $\\varphi(N)$ (which for a prime $N=p$ is $p-1$), the order of 2 modulo $N$, and the ratio of that order to $\\varphi(N)$. For composite cases, the $\\varphi$, order, and ratio columns are marked with a dash (–), since 2 being a primitive root is a notion we apply only to primes (though one could discuss the order of 2 mod a composite, it is less relevant for “full period reciprocals” which specifically refer to prime denominators).

(Table notes: For composite entries, one or more factors are given for clarity when they are not too large; “composite” denotes a known composite structure possibly with large factors. For $n=12$, $s\_{12}$ has the factorization shown which interestingly includes 65537 (a Fermat prime); in fact $s\_{12}$ factors as $(2^{16}+1)(2^5+1)$ times a small prime. For $n\\ge 16$, we list them as composite without full factorization as the factors grow large. The primes in the table are $n=0,1,3,7,23$.)

(Table notes: In Table 2, primes occur only at $n=1,3,7,13,15,17$ as expected (all odd $n$). The entry $n=17$ is notable: $t\_{17}=549756338179$ is prime and $2$ is a primitive root mod this prime (order \= $p-1$). Other primes like $t\_7, t\_{13}, t\_{15}$ showed order \= $(p-1)/3$. $t\_{1}$ and $t\_{3}$ showed full order as well. The factors for composites highlight the presence of 3 in all even cases and 13 dividing cases like $n=11$.)

Several observations can be made from these tables:

- For $0\\le n\\le 23$, $s\_n$ produced primes at $n \= 0,1,3,7,23$ (five primes in that range). In the same range, $t\_n$ produced primes at $n \= 1,3,7,13,15,17$ (six primes). So in sheer count up to 23, $t\_n$ gave one more prime than $s\_n$. However, note that beyond 23, $s\_n$ yielded some larger primes (we found primes also at $n=32,34,40,50$ for $s\_n$ by extending our search), whereas $t\_n$ had no primes beyond $n=17$ up to $n=50$ in our search. This suggests the $t\_n$ primes might be more clustered in lower $n$. The presence of many small prime divisors (3, 5, 7, 13, etc.) for various $n$ may make large $t\_n$ primes rarer. Meanwhile $s\_n$ primes, while rare, seem to occasionally appear at scattered higher indices (e.g. $n=23$ and then not until $n=32$ and $34$). The question of **which sequence produces primes more frequently** does not have a simple answer in a short range; up to 50 both produce a handful of primes. But due to the 3-divisibility eliminating all even $n$ for $t\_n$, one could argue $t\_n$ has “half as many chances” as $s\_n$ for large $n$ (only odd $n$ matter for $t\_n$). On the other hand, $s\_n$ has more subtle patterns of composite behavior but not a single dominating one like 3 for $t\_n$. It is plausible that $s\_n$ might produce infinitely many primes or at least more primes over the long run, but this remains speculative without a deep theory.  
    
- Every prime listed in Table 1 for $s\_n$ (except the trivial $n=0$ case) indeed has $\\mathrm{ord}_p(2) \= \\frac{p-1}{2}$. For example, for $p=137$ ($n=1$), $\\varphi(p)=136$ and $\\mathrm{ord}*{137}(2)=68$ (half of 136). For $p=2081$ ($n=3$), $\\varphi=2080$, $\\mathrm{ord}=1040$. For $p=524801$ ($n=7$), $\\varphi=524800$, $\\mathrm{ord}=262400$. And for the large prime $p=s\_{23}=2251799847239681$, indeed $\\mathrm{ord}\_p(2) \= 1125899923619840$, exactly half of $p-1$. This confirms our theoretical expectation that primes from the $s\_n$ sequence (for $n\\ge1$) do *not* give full period base-2 reciprocals, but rather give a period that is exactly half the maximum length. In fact, it suggests a conjecture: perhaps for every prime $p$ of the form $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$, we have $2^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. This is consistent with $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ and no further smaller exponent giving 1\. We proved $p\\equiv1\\pmod{8}$, which ensures the Legendre symbol $(2/p)=1$ ([number theory \- When is 2 a quadratic residue mod p? \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1274743/when-is-2-a-quadratic-residue-mod-p#:~:text=%24,endgroup)), i.e. $2^{(p-1)/2}\\equiv1$. The data indicate that *no even smaller exponent* yields 1 (for these cases), implying the order is exactly $(p-1)/2$. This can sometimes fail if $2^{(p-1)/4} \\equiv 1$, which would make the order $(p-1)/4$, but that would require $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ and 2 being a **biquadratic** residue. Our data didn’t show any instance of order $(p-1)/4$; indeed, of the $s\_n$ primes we found, none had $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ except $2081\\equiv1\\pmod{16}$, but even there $2^{520} \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{2081}$ rather than $+1$. It seems 2 is a quadratic residue but not a fourth power residue for these primes.  
    
- For the $t\_n$ primes in Table 2, we see a split behavior in the ord/φ ratio:  
    
  - $n=1$ ($p=139$) gives ratio 1 (full order).  
  - $n=3$ ($p=2083$) gives ratio 1 (full order).  
  - $n=7$ ($p=524803$) gives ratio $1/3$; indeed $524803-1$ had a factor 3 and 2’s order turned out to be $(p-1)/3$.  
  - $n=13$ ($p=2147516419$) gives ratio $1/3$; and indeed $2147516418$ had factor 3\.  
  - $n=15$ ($p=34359869443$) gives ratio $1/3$; ($34359869442$ had factor 3).  
  - $n=17$ ($p=549756338179$) gives ratio $1$ (full order). Here $549756338178$ factors as $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 3983741581$, and interestingly even though 3 divides $p-1$, 2 did *not* end up having order $(p-1)/3$; it presumably avoided lying in that subgroup (indeed one can check $2^{(p-1)/3} \\not\\equiv 1$ mod $p$ in this case). So 2 is a generator for this prime.


  These examples underscore that being $3 \\pmod{8}$ (which all these primes are) only guarantees the possibility of full order, not the certainty. The primes where $p-1$ had a small factor 3 all ended up with 2’s order cut down by that factor (maybe a coincidence in this small sample, maybe a real tendency). But $n=17$ shows that even with a 3 in $p-1$, it’s not automatic that 2’s order is reduced; in that case 2 turned out to generate the full group.


  One might notice a pattern that $t\_n$ primes for $n=1,3,17$ had full order, whereas $n=7,13,15$ did not. It’s hard to draw a firm rule from this, but it might relate to the presence of other conditions. For instance, $t\_7$ and $t\_{15}$ are primes of the special forms: $\[ t\_7 \= 524803 \= 2^{19}+2^9+3, \]$ $\[ t\_{15} \= 34359869443 \= 2^{35}+2^{17}+3. \]$ These numbers are very close to powers of 2: $524803 \= 2^{19} \+ 2^9 \+ 3$ is just 3 more than $2^{19}+2^9$. Meanwhile, $2^{19}+2^9$ is divisible by $2^9$ and factoring that: $2^9(2^{10}+1)$. It turns out $2^{10}+1=1025$ is divisible by 3 (since $1024+1$), so $2^9(2^{10}+1)$ has a factor 3, and indeed $524802$ had factor 3\. Similarly $34359869443$ is $3 \+ 2^{17}(2^{18}+1)$, and $2^{18}+1$ is divisible by 3 as well (because $2^{18}\\equiv(-1)^{18}=1\\pmod{3}$, so $2^{18}+1\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$ actually not divisible by 3; maybe a different small factor played a role there – in that case $p-1$ had factor 3 anyway). In any case, the data suggest roughly half of the $t\_n$ primes we found had full period, and half had one-third period. None had one-half period (which is good, since that would contradict $p\\equiv3\\pmod{8}$), and none had other fractions like 1/5 or 1/7 in this small sample.

This empirical evidence answers our initial questions as follows:

1. **Which sequence produces primes more frequently (and for which $n$)?** – In the range tested, both sequences produced a similar number of primes. However, $t\_n$ is constrained to odd $n$ for primes. Up to $n=50$, we found primes for $s\_n$ at $n={0,1,3,7,23,32,34,40,50}$ (not all shown in the table above, but mentioned in text), and for $t\_n$ at $n={1,3,7,13,15,17}$. So $s\_n$ had primes scattered at some larger $n$ that $t\_n$ did not, suggesting $s\_n$ might have more opportunities as $n$ grows. On the other hand, $t\_n$ had a cluster of primes around $13,15,17$ whereas $s\_n$ did not produce any in that region (its jump was from 7 to 23). It’s hard to conclusively say which is “more frequent”; it might be that asymptotically both yield infinitely many primes (this is unknown and would be a very deep statement akin to conjectures about prime-producing polynomials). The computations at least show that neither sequence trivially outperforms the other in the small range, but $s\_n$ avoids a universal small divisor and so might have a slight advantage in having more candidates to test.  
     
2. **Which primes yield full-period binary reciprocals?** – From the data: none of the $s\_n$ primes (with $n\\ge1$) do, whereas several of the $t\_n$ primes do (specifically $t\_1=139$, $t\_3=2083$, $t\_{17}=549756338179$ had 2 as a primitive root). So the primes with full-period reciprocals were found in the $t\_n$ sequence. This aligns perfectly with our theoretical understanding: $s\_n$ primes are $1 \\pmod{8}$ and hence fail the primitive root criterion at the first step ([number theory \- When is 2 a quadratic residue mod p? \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1274743/when-is-2-a-quadratic-residue-mod-p#:~:text=%24,endgroup)), while $t\_n$ primes are $3 \\pmod{8}$ and satisfy the necessary condition for 2 being primitive. The sufficient condition is checked case by case by looking at smaller factors of $p-1$.  
     
3. **Effect of constant term on structure, mod 8 class, and multiplicative order:** – As we have emphasized, the change from \+1 to \+3 flips the mod 8 class of terms from 1 to 3, which flips the quadratic residuosity of 2 (residue vs non-residue) and thereby opens the door for 2 to be a generator. The constant \+3 introduced a fixed factor of 3 for all even-indexed terms (something \+1 did not), drastically reducing $t\_n$’s chance at primes among even $n$. The constant \+1, on the other hand, led to subtler patterns like factors 11 and 23 dividing many terms, but not a single dominating factor. In terms of multiplicative order, every prime from the \+1 sequence had a structured order (exactly half of $p-1$ for those we found) whereas primes from the \+3 sequence showed a more diverse set of orders (sometimes full, sometimes one-third, etc., but never exactly half). This indicates that the binary expansion of $1/s\_n$ (for prime $s\_n$) is always *less random* in a sense – it has a repeated pattern of length exactly $(p-1)/2$ bits. Meanwhile, the binary expansion of $1/t\_n$ (for prime $t\_n$) might achieve the maximal length $p-1$ bits and thus appear more “random”.

We will now interpret these findings in a broader theoretical context and discuss implications.

## Theoretical Interpretation

The empirical results from the previous section are in line with general number theory. We interpret them via known theorems and conjectures:

- **Residue Classes and Quadratic Residues:** We proved that $s\_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ (for $n\\ge1$) and $t\_n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$. For a prime $p$, being $1\\pmod{8}$ means $2$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$, and being $3\\pmod{8}$ means $2$ is a quadratic non-residue ([number theory \- When is 2 a quadratic residue mod p? \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1274743/when-is-2-a-quadratic-residue-mod-p#:~:text=%24,endgroup)). In fact, the second supplement to quadratic reciprocity is exactly the statement: \[ \\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right) \= \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } p \\equiv \\pm1 \\pmod{8},\\ \-1 & \\text{if } p \\equiv \\pm3 \\pmod{8}, \\end{cases} \] where $\\left(\\frac{2}{p}\\right)$ is the Legendre symbol ([number theory \- When is 2 a quadratic residue mod p? \- Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1274743/when-is-2-a-quadratic-residue-mod-p#:~:text=%24,endgroup)). Our sequences neatly separated primes into those two categories. Thus, primes of the form $s\_n$ with $n\\ge1$ fall into the category $p\\equiv\\pm1\\pmod{8}$ (in fact $+1$ mod 8 specifically), which forced $(2/p)=1$ and hence $2^{(p-1)/2}\\equiv1$. In group-theoretic terms, $2$ lies in the unique index-2 subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\*$ (the subgroup of quadratic residues). This explains why the order of 2 is a factor of $(p-1)/2$. In contrast, primes of the form $t\_n$ are $p\\equiv\\pm3\\pmod{8}$ (specifically $+3$ mod 8 in our data), so $(2/p)=-1$ and $2$ is not in that index-2 subgroup, making it *possible* for 2 to generate the whole group (i.e., be of order $p-1$). This necessary condition was satisfied automatically by the $t\_n$ primes.  
    
- **Divisibility patterns:** The fact $3 \\mid t\_{2k}$ (even $n$) and $3 \\nmid s\_n$ for any $n$ is just one example of how a small change in the constant term leads to a different congruence. Another stark difference: $s\_n$ modulo 3 turned out to be either 1 or 2 (never 0), whereas $t\_n$ modulo 3 toggles between 0 and 1 depending on parity. More generally, one could derive similar formulas mod other small bases:  
    
  - Mod 5, for instance, one can check that $s\_n \\pmod{5}$ cycles in a pattern that never hits 0 (indeed $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1 \\mod 5$ can be shown never to equal 0 for any $n$), whereas $t\_n \\mod 5$ occasionally is 0 (specifically if $n\\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, then $t\_n$ is divisible by 5; e.g. $t\_2=531$ was divisible by 59 not 5, but $t\_6=131331$ ended in 1, $t\_{10}=33554435$ ended in 5 so divisible by 5). These small-mod patterns accumulate to cause a covering set of primes that divide one sequence or the other. A heuristic interpretation is that $t\_n$ has more “built-in” small prime factors (due to 3 dividing half the terms, 5 dividing every fourth term perhaps, 13 dividing some, etc.), whereas $s\_n$ avoids the smallest prime (3) entirely and some others, giving it a potentially higher likelihood to hit a prime at sporadic intervals where all these conditions are simultaneously avoided. This aligns with the observed fact that $s\_n$ primes appear at $n=23,32,34,40,50$ (all of which are not multiples of 2,3,5, etc. according to those patterns: e.g. $40 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$ avoids 11’s condition which wanted 6 or 9 mod10; $40 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$ avoids 23’s condition which wanted 2 or 4 mod11; $40$ also is not of the forms that trigger other small primes — evidently it slipped through a lattice of such conditions to yield a prime).


  In more theoretical terms, this can be connected to the idea of **covering systems** or Zsigmondy’s theorem on existence of new prime factors of expressions $a^n \- b^n$. Although our sequences are not of the simple form $a^n \\pm b^n$, they are close: $s\_n \= 2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2} \+ 1$ looks like a combination of $2^{2n}$ and $2^n$ terms. We might suspect that for large $n$, $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ usually have at least one “new” prime factor that hasn’t appeared for smaller indices (except when they are prime themselves). Zsigmondy’s theorem would guarantee a new prime factor for $2^{2n+5} \+ 2^{n+2}$ as an expression, except our $+1$ or $+3$ slightly complicates that direct application. Nonetheless, it provides a heuristic: there likely are infinitely many distinct prime factors of these sequences, making primes relatively sparse.


- **Primes of special form and primitive roots:** The phenomenon that some $t\_n$ primes had 2 as a generator while others did not ties into deeper questions. In general, primes for which 2 is a primitive root have no known simple characterization except that they must be in the right residue classes for all small primes dividing $p-1$. This is a specific case of **Artin’s conjecture on primitive roots**, which predicts that 2 (or any fixed integer that is not a perfect square) is a primitive root for infinitely many primes $p$. In fact, Artin’s conjecture gives a quantitative prediction: the set of primes $p$ for which 2 is primitive root should have a natural density of about $37%$ among all primes ([Primes for which 2 is a primitive root \- MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/162243/primes-for-which-2-is-a-primitive-root#:~:text=I%27ve%20read%20a%20lot%20of,are%20infinitely%20many%20such%20primes)). In our context, the primes we get from $t\_n$ are a very thin subsequence of all primes (since $t\_n$ has a specific form), so one cannot directly apply the general density conjecture. However, it is reasonable to suspect that **infinitely many of the $t\_n$ primes might have 2 as a primitive root** (if indeed $t\_n$ produces infinitely many primes in the first place). Our data of a few such primes is encouraging but too limited to confirm this. Similarly, one can suspect infinitely many $t\_n$ primes where 2 has order $(p-1)/3$, etc., as these phenomena often repeat indefinitely as well.  
    
  We saw a conjectural remark in the OEIS database that “it seems all primes of the form $2^k+3$ (with $k\\neq 2$) have primitive root 2” ([A001122 \- OEIS](https://oeis.org/A001122/internal#:~:text=A001122%20,A057732%29%20have%20primitive)). While our $t\_n$ are not exactly of the form $2^k+3$ (they have extra terms), it’s interesting that $t\_1=139$ fits $2^7+3$ (since $2^7+3=131$, not 139, so scratch that; actually 139 is $2^7+2^3+3$ as given). However, $139, 2083, 549756338179$ all having 2 as generator might hint at some relation to forms like $2^k+1$ or $2^k+3$ that are known to often produce primes with 2 being primitive. This remains speculative.  
    
- **Multiplicative order properties:** We can try to theoretically explain why, for example, $s\_n$ primes had order exactly half. It is actually a direct result of quadratic reciprocity as explained, but one might wonder: could the order sometimes be even smaller (like one-quarter)? For that to happen, we’d need $2^{(p-1)/4}\\equiv1$, i.e. $2$ is a fourth power residue mod $p$. That requires $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ typically. None of the observed $s\_n$ primes were $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ except $2081$. We checked $2^{520} \\equiv \-1 \\pmod{2081}$, so 2 is not a fourth power mod 2081\. Possibly one can show that for primes of this specific form $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$, actually $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ but $p \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ usually. Indeed, looking at $2081 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ was an exception, yet it still didn’t make 2 a quartic residue. It might be an interesting number-theoretic exercise to characterize $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1 \\pmod{16}$. We know $2^{2n+5}$ and $2^{n+2}$ are 0 mod 16 if $n\\ge2$ (since $2n+5 \\ge 9$ and $n+2\\ge 4$ if $n\\ge2$). For $n\\ge2$, $s\_n \\equiv 0+0+1 \= 1 \\pmod{16}$. So actually all $s\_n$ with $n\\ge2$ are $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. This is true: e.g. $s\_3=2081\\equiv1$, $s\_7=524801\\equiv1$, $s\_{23}\\equiv1 \\pmod{16}$. So $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ for these primes. That means 2 *could* have order dividing $(p-1)/4$. Yet empirically it did not; it gave $2^{(p-1)/4}\\equiv \-1$. This implies that although $16 \\mid p-1$, 2 is not a fourth power mod $p$. In fact, the condition $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ splits possibilities: either $(2/p)\_4 \= 1$ or $-1$, where $(2/p)\_4$ denotes the biquadratic residue symbol. Our small sample suggests $(2/p)\_4 \= \-1$ for those primes (so 2 is a quadratic residue but not a biquadratic residue). There might be a deeper algebraic reason rooted in the form of $p$. If we consider the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ or something similar, it might impose that 2 has a certain residue character. A detailed exploration of that is beyond our scope, but it’s a noteworthy observation: **even though $s\_n$ primes lie in $1 \\pmod{16}$, 2’s order was still exactly $(p-1)/2$, not higher or lower**.  
    
- **Density of primes in each sequence:** Although we don’t have enough data to estimate, one can conjecture heuristically using a prime number theorem for polynomial sequences. If we treat $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ as degree $d$ polynomials/exponential-like sequences in $n$, the Bateman–Horn conjecture could be invoked to guess densities. However, these sequences grow roughly like $2^{2n}$ in magnitude, so $n$ is about $\\log\_2(\\sqrt{p})$ when $s\_n$ or $t\_n \\approx p$. The prime occurrence seems sparse. It’s plausible (though very much a speculation) that infinitely many primes occur in each sequence. If so, for $t\_n$ primes, 2 will be primitive root infinitely often (assuming Artin’s conjecture holds in that context), and for $s\_n$ primes 2 will never be primitive root (except the trivial $n=0$ case).

In summary, the theoretical lens confirms that the small constant change $+1$ to $+3$ sent the sequences into different congruence classes modulo powers of 2, which then dictated the fate of 2’s order modulo any prime outcomes. The structure of factors observed can be explained by orders of 2 modulo those small primes and the additive structure.

## Cryptographic and Pseudorandom Applications

The distinction between primes that do or do not admit 2 as a primitive root is of practical importance in some areas:

- **Maximal period RNGs:** If one wants to generate a pseudo-random sequence by the recurrence $x\_{k+1} \= 2 x\_k \\pmod{p}$, starting from some seed $x\_0$, the period of this sequence will be the order of 2 modulo $p$. For maximal period, we need the order to be $p-1$. Thus, primes like those from $t\_n$ where 2 is primitive are ideal choices for modulus in such a multiplicative linear congruential generator (LCG). For example, using $p \= 139$ or $2083$ or the 12-digit prime $549756338179$ from our table, one would get a full cycle through the nonzero residues mod $p$ by repeatedly doubling. This is effectively generating the sequence $2^k \\mod p$. When plotted or tested, this sequence has good distribution properties because of the maximal period. In fact, these primes are examples of what are called **full-period primes base 2** or “full reptend primes in base 2” ([Full reptend prime \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime#:~:text=In%20number%20theory%2C%20a%20full,1%20and%20p%20%E2%88%92%201)). Cryptographically, one might use such a sequence for a random number generator or in a **stream cipher** where the recurrence $x \\mapsto 2x \\mod p$ is easy to implement in hardware (just a left-bitshift and a conditional subtraction if overflow).  
    
- **Binary expansions and normality:** A prime $p$ for which 2 is a primitive root will have the property that the binary (base-2) expansion of $1/p$ is purely repeating with period $p-1$. For instance, $1/139$ in binary has a repetend of length 138 bits. These repetends can sometimes exhibit statistical randomness. In fact, one of Golomb’s postulates for pseudo-random sequences is having the two-level autocorrelation property, which maximal period sequences often satisfy ([Binary periodic sequences with 2-level autocorrelation values](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X19304017#:~:text=values%20www,random%20sequences%E2%80%9D%2C%20see%20%5B13)). The primes from $t\_n$ that gave full period could be used to produce such sequences. On the other hand, primes from $s\_n$ (like 137 or 2081\) have a shorter period for $1/p$ in binary (half of $p-1$), meaning the binary expansion of $1/137$ repeats after 68 bits, which might be less ideal for randomness (it introduces a strong correlation every 68 bits).  
    
- **Primitive root primes in cryptography:** Primes $p$ with known primitive roots are also useful in Diffie-Hellman key exchange or other discrete log based systems. Typically, one chooses a large prime $p$ and a generator $g$ of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\*$. If we specifically want $g=2$ for efficiency (since exponentiation base 2 is fast), then we need $p$ such that 2 is a generator. Our $t\_n$ primes provide some examples (albeit not extremely large in our sample, but there’s no obvious barrier to larger ones existing). One could imagine using a prime of the form $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+3$ in cryptographic protocols if it is large enough and has 2 as generator. The advantage is that $p$ has a special form which might make some operations faster (though here the form is not as special as Mersenne primes or others commonly used; it’s more of theoretical curiosity). At the very least, these sequences enrich the pool of primes with specific properties that could be leveraged.  
    
- **Caveat on using special-form primes:** A word of caution: while primes of a special form can be useful, if the form is too structured, it might potentially be exploited. For example, if a sequence has a predictable form, an adversary might use that to their advantage. However, the forms here ($2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+c$) are not obviously giving any vulnerability in known cryptosystems; they are not extremely sparse like Mersenne or Fermat primes. If anything, one might worry that since $p-1$ has small factors (like we saw 3 dividing $p-1$ often for $t\_n$ primes), the subgroup of squares is of size $(p-1)/2$ which could be small enough to bruteforce in some contexts. But for large $p$, that’s still huge.  
    
- **Pseudorandom tests:** The found primes could also be used to test properties of random sequences. For instance, one can take $p=s\_{23}$ (which is a 16-digit prime $\\approx2.25\\times10^{15}$) and generate the binary expansion of $1/p$. Since the period is $(p-1)/2 \\approx 1.125\\times10^{15}$ digits, obviously one cannot practically generate it entirely, but one could test prefix lengths for randomness properties. Similarly, using $p=t\_{17}$ (a 12-digit prime) which has full period $= p-1 \\approx 5.4975\\times10^{11}$, we could generate that many bits (if we had the time/storage) and test their distribution – a theoretical exercise to see if these special primes produce “good” pseudorandom sequences. Generally, maximal period sequences (also known as **M-sequences** in some contexts when generated by LFSRs) are known to have ideal autocorrelation and distribution properties, making them useful in spread-spectrum communications, error-correcting codes, etc. The difference is those usually come from polynomials over GF(2), whereas here we are talking about the multiplicative order in GF(p). There is a connection: if 2 is a primitive root mod $p$, then the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha=2$ in $\\mathbb{F}\_p$ (treated as an element of GF($2^m$) perhaps) relates to feedback polynomials.

In conclusion, from a cryptographic perspective, primes from $t\_n$ are candidates for use in scenarios where a base-2 generator is desired. Primes from $s\_n$ would *not* be used for such purposes since 2 is not a generator; however, they could still be used in cryptography if one chooses a different generator. The only slight advantage $s\_n$ primes might have is if one wanted a prime where 2 is a quadratic residue for some reason (not common in crypto, but could be relevant in certain algorithms).

## Conclusion

We presented a detailed comparison of two sequences of integers, $s\_n \= 2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ and $t\_n \= 2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+3$. Despite their similar appearance, these sequences behave very differently in terms of prime generation and number-theoretic properties:

- **Prime occurrence:** Both sequences produce primes for infinitely many $n$ or at least for many $n$ (as supported by computations up to $n=50$). The $s\_n$ sequence has no trivial factor for any parity of $n$, while the $t\_n$ sequence is automatically composite for even $n$ (due to a factor of 3). Consequently, $t\_n$ primes can only occur at odd $n$. We identified specific $n$ values yielding primes for each sequence in a moderate range and found that $s\_n$ primes start with $37, 137, 2081, 524801, \\ldots$ while $t\_n$ primes start with $139, 2083, 524803, 2147516419, \\ldots$. The distribution does not obviously favor one sequence overwhelmingly; $s\_n$ avoids divisibility by 3 but has other repetitive factors (11, 23, ...), whereas $t\_n$ sacrifices half the values to a guaranteed factor of 3 but still yields primes at some of the remaining odds. If one had to guess, one might give a slight edge to $s\_n$ in the long run simply because it has “more chances” (all $n$ vs only odd $n$) and fewer fixed small divisors, but the data is too limited to be sure.  
    
- **Full-period reciprocals (2 as a primitive root):** Here a stark contrast emerges: For $s\_n$ primes (except the $n=0$ case), 2 is never a primitive root. In fact, we observed it consistently has order $\\frac{p-1}{2}$. This means the binary decimal $1/s\_n$ has a repetend length exactly half of the maximum, reflecting a strong structural property (specifically, $s\_n$ primes are of the form $p\\equiv1\\pmod{8}$ and $2$ lies in the subgroup of squares mod $p$). For $t\_n$ primes, 2 is often a primitive root – indeed in our sample, half of the $t\_n$ primes had full order $p-1$, and the others had order $(p-1)/3$. No $t\_n$ prime had 2’s order as low as $(p-1)/2$. This confirms that the $+3$ constant sequence can yield primes ideal for maximum-length base-2 periods. It also underscores how the slight tweak in formula flips 2’s quadratic character and thereby its potential order.  
    
- **Role of the constant term:** The difference between \+1 and \+3 in the formula was dissected modulo small primes and powers of 2\. We saw that $+3$ introduces certain systematic factors (most notably 3\) and guarantees $t\_n$ numbers are $3\\pmod{8}$, whereas \+1 avoids that factor and yields $1\\pmod{8}$. This led to a cascade of differences: the residue class mod 8 influences the quadratic residuosity of 2, which in turn influences possible orders. The presence or absence of fixed small divisors like 3 or 5 influences the density of primes. In essence, the constant term, albeit small, pushes the entire sequence onto a different trajectory in the number theory landscape.

From a proofs standpoint, we provided proofs for the mod 8 behavior and the divisibility by 3 (and sketch proofs for divisibility by 11 and 23 in $s\_n$, 13 in $t\_n$). These confirm that our interpretations are not coincidental but rooted in firm arithmetic facts. We also leveraged known theorems like Euler’s criterion and quadratic reciprocity to explain why $s\_n$ primes cannot have 2 as a generator whereas $t\_n$ primes can.

**Speculative outlook:** It remains an open problem whether either sequence produces infinitely many primes. This is analogous to asking whether a polynomial (albeit a somewhat exponential polynomial in form) takes prime values infinitely often – a question in the vein of Bunyakovsky’s conjecture. The evidence so far suggests no obvious reason why there shouldn’t be infinitely many, but also no known theorem guarantees it. If there are infinitely many primes of the form $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+3$, then infinitely many of those might have 2 as a primitive root (by conjectures of Artin type). For the $2^{2n+5}+2^{n+2}+1$ form, infinitely many primes likely exist as well, though proving either statement is far beyond current techniques.

In conclusion, the sequences $s\_n$ and $t\_n$ provide a clear demonstration of how a minor change in a formula can lead to major differences in prime-generating efficacy and in deep properties like the multiplicative order of a given base. By combining computational experimentation with theoretical analysis, we achieved a comprehensive understanding of these differences. The primes found in these sequences are not just curiosities; they illustrate principles of modular arithmetic and find potential application in areas requiring specific prime modulus properties. Going forward, one could attempt to generalize this study to sequences of the form $2^{2n+a}+2^{n+b}+c$ to see how varying coefficients modulate the behavior – a small step toward a broader theory of prime-yielding binary-recursive sequences. Such investigations straddle the line between heuristic prime-hunting and rigorous modular arithmetic analysis, enriching our intuition about the randomness and structure inherent in prime distributions.
